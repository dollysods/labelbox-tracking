Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. (2) He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. (3) One day he said to her: ‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating. (4) Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. (5) The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. (6) The cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. (7) It would not stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. (8) The cow-herd said: ‘It must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away. (9) And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. (10) They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. (11) On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. (12) But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. (13) The miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. (14) The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. (15) Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine. (16) Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. (17) The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! (18) It is my husband!’ she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. (19) Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank heaven, you are back again! (20) There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. (21) After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. (22) ‘Why not?’ answered the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. (23) The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. (24) ‘Now go on,’ said he. (25) The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.

Book Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Book Author: Lewis Carroll

Paragraph: (1) “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”



“You ought to have finished,” said the King. (2) “When did you begin?”

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. (3) “Fourteenth of March, Ithinkit was,” he said. (4) “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare. (5) “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse. (6) “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. (7) “Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter. (8) “It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter. (9) “Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. (10) “I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own. (11) I’m a hatter.”

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. (12) “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.”



This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. (13) Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. (14) “I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. (15) “I can hardly breathe.”

“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”



“You’ve no right to growhere,” said the Dormouse. (16) “Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing too.”



“Yes, butIgrow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. (17) All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. (18) “Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”



“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”



“The twinkling of thewhat?” said the King. (19) “Itbeganwith the tea,” the Hatter replied. (20) “Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. (21) “Do you take me for a dunce? (22) Go on!”

“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”



“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. (23) “You did!” said the Hatter. (24) “I deny it!” said the March Hare. (25) “He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”



“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. (26) “After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”



“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked. (27) “That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter. (28) “Youmustremember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”



The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. (29) “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began. (30) “You’re averypoorspeaker,” said the King.

Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. (2) He had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost. (3) Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble. (4) One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. (5) ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. (6) ‘Who knows but I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land. (7) ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’ said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him. (8) But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed. (9) Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in. (10) About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. (11) At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before. (12) Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. (13) The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. (14) Then Heinel said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the little man.’



When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. (15) The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. (16) At last the boy said to him. (17) ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. (18) ‘Have you brought me what you said you would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. (19) The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. (20) Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. (21) Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company. (22) So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather. (23) Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge. (24) The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. (25) The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land. (26) As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. (27) ‘Here,’ said he to himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers. (28) Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? (29) Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for you alone can save me. (30) This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) Early one morning in December John had just led me into my box after my daily exercise, and was strapping my cloth on and James was coming in from the corn chamber with some oats, when the master came into the stable. (2) He looked rather serious, and held an open letter in his hand. (3) John fastened the door of my box, touched his cap, and waited for orders. (4) “Good-morning, John,” said the master. (5) “I want to know if you have any complaint to make of James.”



“Complaint, sir? (6) No, sir.”

“Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?”



“Yes, sir, always.”



“You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?”



“Never, sir.”



“That's well; but I must put another question. (7) Have you no reason to suspect, when he goes out with the horses to exercise them or to take a message, that he stops about talking to his acquaintances, or goes into houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?”



“No, sir, certainly not; and if anybody has been saying that about James, I don't believe it, and I don't mean to believe it unless I have it fairly proved before witnesses; it's not for me to say who has been trying to take away James' character, but I will say this, sir, that a steadier, pleasanter, honester, smarter young fellow I never had in this stable. (8) I can trust his word and I can trust his work; he is gentle and clever with the horses, and I would rather have them in charge with him than with half the young fellows I know of in laced hats and liveries; and whoever wants a character of James Howard,” said John, with a decided jerk of his head, “let them come to John Manly.”



The master stood all this time grave and attentive, but as John finished his speech a broad smile spread over his face, and looking kindly across at James, who all this time had stood still at the door, he said, “James, my lad, set down the oats and come here; I am very glad to find that John's opinion of your character agrees so exactly with my own. (9) John is a cautious man,” he said, with a droll smile, “and it is not always easy to get his opinion about people, so I thought if I beat the bush on this side the birds would fly out, and I should learn what I wanted to know quickly; so now we will come to business. (10) I have a letter from my brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, of Clifford Hall. (11) He wants me to find him a trustworthy young groom, about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. (12) His old coachman, who has lived with him thirty years, is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place. (13) He would have eighteen shillings a week at first, a stable suit, a driving suit, a bedroom over the coachhouse, and a boy under him. (14) Sir Clifford is a good master, and if you could get the place it would be a good start for you. (15) I don't want to part with you, and if you left us I know John would lose his right hand.”



“That I should, sir,” said John, “but I would not stand in his light for the world.”



“How old are you, James?” said master. (16) “Nineteen next May, sir.”

“That's young; what do you think, John?”



“Well, sir, it is young; but he is as steady as a man, and is strong, and well grown, and though he has not had much experience in driving, he has a light firm hand and a quick eye, and he is very careful, and I am quite sure no horse of his will be ruined for want of having his feet and shoes looked after.”



“Your word will go the furthest, John,” said the master, “for Sir Clifford adds in a postscript, 'If I could find a man trained by your John I should like him better than any other;' so, James, lad, think it over, talk to your mother at dinner-time, and then let me know what you wish.”



In a few days after this conversation it was fully settled that James should go to Clifford Hall, in a month or six weeks, as it suited his master, and in the meantime he was to get all the practice in driving that could be given to him. (17) I never knew the carriage to go out so often before; when the mistress did not go out the master drove himself in the two-wheeled chaise; but now, whether it was master or the young ladies, or only an errand, Ginger and I were put in the carriage and James drove us. (18) At the first John rode with him on the box, telling him this and that, and after that James drove alone. (19) Then it was wonderful what a number of places the master would go to in the city on Saturday, and what queer streets we were driven through.

Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons. (2) This king once fell very ill—so ill that nobody thought he could live. (3) His sons were very much grieved at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. (4) They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. (5) ‘I know what would,’ said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. (6) If he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him. (7) ‘No,’ said the king. (8) ‘I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.’



Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said the prince haughtily, and rode on. (9) But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. (10) He next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound. (11) Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish. (12) So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on. (13) But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains. (14) Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice. (15) When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again. (16) So he set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? (17) Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. (18) ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do not. (19) Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. (20) The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.’



Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) I think the harness had an extra polish. (2) Willie seemed half-anxious, half-merry, as he got into the chaise with his grandfather. (3) “If the ladies take to him,” said the old gentleman, “they'll be suited and he'll be suited. (4) We can but try.”

At the distance of a mile or two from the village we came to a pretty, low house, with a lawn and shrubbery at the front and a drive up to the door. (5) Willie rang the bell, and asked if Miss Blomefield or Miss Ellen was at home. (6) Yes, they were. (7) So, while Willie stayed with me, Mr. Thoroughgood went into the house. (8) In about ten minutes he returned, followed by three ladies; one tall, pale lady, wrapped in a white shawl, leaned on a younger lady, with dark eyes and a merry face; the other, a very stately-looking person, was Miss Blomefield. (9) They all came and looked at me and asked questions. (10) The younger lady—that was Miss Ellen—took to me very much; she said she was sure she should like me, I had such a good face. (11) The tall, pale lady said that she should always be nervous in riding behind a horse that had once been down, as I might come down again, and if I did she should never get over the fright. (12) “You see, ladies,” said Mr. Thoroughgood, “many first-rate horses have had their knees broken through the carelessness of their drivers without any fault of their own, and from what I see of this horse I should say that is his case; but of course I do not wish to influence you. (13) If you incline you can have him on trial, and then your coachman will see what he thinks of him.”



“You have always been such a good adviser to us about our horses,” said the stately lady, “that your recommendation would go a long way with me, and if my sister Lavinia sees no objection we will accept your offer of a trial, with thanks.”



It was then arranged that I should be sent for the next day. (14) In the morning a smart-looking young man came for me. (15) At first he looked pleased; but when he saw my knees he said in a disappointed voice:



“I didn't think, sir, you would have recommended my ladies a blemished horse like that.”



“'Handsome is that handsome does',” said my master; “you are only taking him on trial, and I am sure you will do fairly by him, young man. (16) If he is not as safe as any horse you ever drove send him back.”



I was led to my new home, placed in a comfortable stable, fed, and left to myself. (17) The next day, when the groom was cleaning my face, he said:



“That is just like the star that 'Black Beauty' had; he is much the same height, too. (18) I wonder where he is now.”

A little further on he came to the place in my neck where I was bled and where a little knot was left in the skin. (19) He almost started, and began to look me over carefully, talking to himself. (20) “White star in the forehead, one white foot on the off side, this little knot just in that place;” then looking at the middle of my back—“and, as I am alive, there is that little patch of white hair that John used to call 'Beauty's three-penny bit'. (21) It must be 'Black Beauty'! (22) Why, Beauty! (23) Beauty! (24) do you know me? (25) little Joe Green, that almost killed you?” And he began patting and patting me as if he was quite overjoyed. (26) I could not say that I remembered him, for now he was a fine grown young fellow, with black whiskers and a man's voice, but I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad. (27) I put my nose up to him, and tried to say that we were friends. (28) I never saw a man so pleased. (29) “Give you a fair trial! (30) I should think so indeed!

Book Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Book Author: Lewis Carroll

Paragraph: (1) I only wish people knewthat: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”



She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. (2) “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. (3) I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”



“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark. (4) “Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. (5) “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke. (6) Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess wasveryugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. (7) However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. (8) “The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. (9) “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”



“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”



“Ah, well! (10) It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral ofthatis—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”



“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself. (11) “I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. (12) Shall I try the experiment?”

“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. (13) “Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. (14) And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”



“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked. (15) “Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”



“It’s a mineral, Ithink,” said Alice. (16) “Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. (17) And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”



“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. (18) It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”

“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”



“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”



“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. (19) “Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice. (20) “Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. (21) “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”



“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. (22) “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud. (23) “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. (24) “I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. (25) “Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”



But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. (26) Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. (27) “A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. (28) “Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! (29) Take your choice!”

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. (2) The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. (3) But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! (4) I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave. (5) When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. (6) ‘Did not you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.’



The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green. (7) And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:

Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will? (8) What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. (9) ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. (10) ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at least,’ said his wife. (11) Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, ‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!’



The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:



‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. (12) ‘Ah!’ said the man, dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. (13) ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. (14) ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed. (15) The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? (16) I will not be king.’ ‘Then I will,’ said she. (17) ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you be king—the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say no more about it, but go and try! (18) I will be king.’ So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. (19) This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:



‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. (20) ‘Alas!’ said the poor man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king already.’



Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. (21) And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other.

Paragraph: (1) She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. (2) “Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon. (3) “I’mnota serpent!” said Alice indignantly. (4) “Let me alone!”

“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”



“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice. (5) “I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! (6) There’s no pleasing them!”

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. (7) “As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! (8) Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”



“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. (9) “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! (10) Ugh, Serpent!”

“But I’mnota serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. (11) “I’m a—I’m a—”

“Well!Whatare you?” said the Pigeon. (12) “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”

“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. (13) “A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. (14) “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but neveronewith such a neck as that! (15) No, no! (16) You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. (17) I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”



“Ihavetasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”



“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”



This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I knowthatwell enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”



“It matters a good deal tome,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t wantyours: I don’t like them raw.”



“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. (18) Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. (19) After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. (20) It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. (21) “Come, there’s half my plan done now! (22) How puzzling all these changes are! (23) I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! (24) However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—howisthat to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. (25) “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon themthissize: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.

Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) ‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into puddings, and put him in the pot. (2) But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt. (3) Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked, ‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing. (4) The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’

‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’



‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’



‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six weeks; he is well looked after there.’



‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’



With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do you weep? (5) Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table. (6) Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep. (7) Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more. (8) And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. (9) After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone. (10) Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate. (11) The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to sing:



The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the song of the bird on his roof. (12) He thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. (13) But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street. (14) ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! (15) Sing me that song again.’

‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. (16) Give that gold chain, and I will sing it you again.’



‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. (17) ‘Only sing me that again.’

The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:



Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and sang:



The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun. (18) ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head. (19) ‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’



‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must give me something.’



‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched the shoes. (20) ‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’



The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:



When he had finished, he flew away. (21) He had the chain in his right claw and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’

 Inside the mill were twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack, hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’



The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:



then one of the men left off,



two more men left off and listened,



then four more left off,



Now there were only eight at work,



and now only five,



and now only one,



then he looked up and the last one had left off work. (22) ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! (23) Let me hear it too; sing it again.’

‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that millstone, and I will sing it again.’



‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’



‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’



The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree and sang—



And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house. (24) The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner. (25) ‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’



‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming.’



But little Marleen sat and wept and wept. (26) Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof. (27) ‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’



‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears. (28) The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:



the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:



‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!’



then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed. (29) ‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man. (30) ‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) On arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her child, its nurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms. (2) On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother’s. (3) There he found his mother, who had come from Moscow on business. (4) His mother and sister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with Anna. (5) His brother came the next morning to see Vronsky, and of his own accord asked him about her, and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a divorce, and then to marry her, and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife, and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so. (6) “If the world disapproves, I don’t care,” said Vronsky; “but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have to be on the same terms with my wife.”



The elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger brother’s judgment, could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question; for his part he had nothing against it, and with Alexey he went up to see Anna. (7) Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they talked about Anna’s going to Vronsky’s estate. (8) In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange misapprehension. (9) One would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion. (10) “Of course,” he thought, “she would not be received at court, but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light.” One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one’s legs crossed in the same position, if one knows that there’s nothing to prevent one’s changing one’s position; but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them. (11) This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world. (12) Though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them. (13) But he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally, it was closed for Anna. (14) Just as in the game of cat and mouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for Anna. (15) One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his cousin Betsy. (16) “At last!” she greeted him joyfully. (17) “And Anna? (18) How glad I am! (19) Where are you stopping? (20) I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid. (21) I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome. (22) How about the divorce?

Book Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Book Author: Lewis Carroll

Paragraph: (1) “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in. (2) The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. (3) “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. (4) There was certainly too much of it in the air. (5) Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. (6) The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. (7) “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”



“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. (8) Pig!”

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—



“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that catscouldgrin.”



“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”



“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. (9) “You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”



Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. (10) While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. (11) The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. (12) “Oh,pleasemind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. (13) “Oh, there goes hispreciousnose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. (14) “If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”



“Which wouldnotbe an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. (15) “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! (16) You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”



“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”



Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, Ithink; or is it twelve? (17) I—”

“Oh, don’t botherme,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:



“Speak roughly to your little boy,And beat him when he sneezes:He only does it to annoy,Because he knows it teases.”



CHORUS. (18) (In which the cook and the baby joined):

“Wow! (19) wow! (20) wow!”

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—



“I speak severely to my boy,I beat him when he sneezes;For he can thoroughly enjoyThe pepper when he pleases!”



CHORUS. (21) “Wow! (22) wow! (23) wow!”

“Here! (24) you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. (25) “I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. (26) The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her. (27) Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. (28) The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. (29) As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. (30) “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left off questioning himself about it. (2) It seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation. (3) Indeed, in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been. (4) When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back also to his usual pursuits. (5) The management of the estate, his relations with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the management of his sister’s and brother’s property, of which he had the direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his child, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring, filled all his time. (6) These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had completely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing—that he could not do otherwise. (7) In former days—almost from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood—when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it vanished into nothing. (8) But now, since his marriage, when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing, he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more. (9) Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow. (10) To live the same family life as his father and forefathers—that is, in the same condition of culture—and to bring up his children in the same, was incontestably necessary. (11) It was as necessary as dining when one was hungry. (12) And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income. (13) Just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son, when he received it as a heritage, would say “thank you” to his father as Levin had said “thank you” to his grandfather for all he built and planted. (14) And to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields, and plant timber. (15) It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch, of his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so—as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one’s arms. (16) It was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day. (17) And all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up the whole of Levin’s life, which had no meaning at all for him, when he began to think. (18) But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just the same wayhowhe had to do it all, and what was more important than the rest. (19) He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable. (20) Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income. (21) Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment. (22) To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) It seemed to her that, knowing this, he might sooner cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love, though she had no grounds for fearing it. (2) But she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and showing that she appreciated it. (3) He, who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career, in which he would have been certain to play a leading part—he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake, and never betrayed the slightest regret. (4) He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever, and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant. (5) He, so manly a man, never opposed her, had indeed, with her, no will of his own, and was anxious, it seemed, for nothing but to anticipate her wishes. (6) And she could not but appreciate this, even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her, the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her, sometimes weighed upon her. (7) Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. (8) He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. (9) It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires. (10) For a time after joining his life to hers, and putting on civilian dress, he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love,—and he was content, but not for long. (11) He was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires—ennui. (12) Without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking it for a desire and an object. (13) Sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete freedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in Petersburg. (14) As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they could not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the cause—a late supper with bachelor friends. (15) Relations with the society of the place—foreign and Russian—were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position. (16) The inspection of objects of interest, apart from the fact that everything had been seen already, had not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit. (17) And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get, hoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures. (18) As he had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what to spend his money on, he had begun collecting engravings, he came to a stop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction. (19) He had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for imitating art, he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select—religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting—he set to work to paint. (20) He appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired by anyone of them; but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school. (21) Since he knew nothing of this, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly from life embodied in art, his inspiration came very quickly and easily, and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate. (22) More than any other style he liked the French—graceful and effective—and in that style he began to paint Anna’s portrait in Italian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to everyone who saw it, extremely successful.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg. (2) Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. (3) Katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite different. (4) Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped. (5) “Yes, here he’s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land,” said Katavasov; “I’m not a specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development.”



“That’s very interesting,” said Metrov. (6) “What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,” said Levin, reddening, “I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.”



And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound his views. (7) He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man. (8) “But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian laborer?” said Metrov; “in his biological characteristics, so to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?”



Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree. (9) But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the East. (10) “One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people,” said Metrov, interrupting Levin. (11) “The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital.”



And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory. (12) In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because he did not take the trouble to understand. (13) He saw that Metrov, like other people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and rent. (14) He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern—much the larger—part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools. (15) Yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer, though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin. (16) Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections. (17) He would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov’s theories superfluous. (18) But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he did not even oppose his statements, but simply listened. (19) Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him. (20) It flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin’s understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject. (21) He put this down to his own credit, unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him, even if still obscure to himself. (22) “We are late though,” said Katavasov, looking at his watch directly Metrov had finished his discourse. (23) “Yes, there’s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,” said Katavasov in answer to Levin’s inquiry. (24) “Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going. (25) I’ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology. (26) Come along with us, it’s very interesting.”

“Yes, and indeed it’s time to start,” said Metrov. (27) “Come with us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place. (28) I should very much like to hear your work.”

“Oh, no! (29) It’s no good yet, it’s unfinished. (30) But I shall be very glad to go to the meeting.”

“I say, friends, have you heard?

Book Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Book Author: Lewis Carroll

Paragraph: (1) There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. (2) Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! (3) either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. (4) However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! (5) Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. (6) How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. (7) Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! (8) I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. (9) There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters. (10) It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to dothatin a hurry. (11) “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because theywouldnot remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your fingerverydeeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. (12) However, this bottle wasnotmarked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. (13) * * * * * * ** * * * * ** * * * * * *

“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”



And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. (14) First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. (15) I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. (16) After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! (17) when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. (18) “Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. (19) “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! (20) Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to makeonerespectable person!”



Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. (21) “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”



She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? (22) Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. (23) So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. (24) * * * * * * ** * * * * ** * * * * * *

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky. (2) Then he began being in love with the second. (3) He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of the sisters, only he could not quite make out which. (4) But Natalia, too, had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov. (5) Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university. (6) Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin’s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate. (7) But when early in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love. (8) One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match. (9) But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her. (10) After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country. (11) Levin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him. (12) In her family’s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky. (13) But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else. (14) The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way striking person. (15) Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the past—the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his friendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love. (16) An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man. (17) He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women. (18) But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest; that he could not live without deciding the question, would she or would she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected. (19) And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer, and get married if he were accepted. (20) Or ... he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) It was some time before he came. (2) He was a fine-looking, middle-aged man, and his voice said at once that he expected to be obeyed. (3) He was very friendly and polite to John, and after giving us a slight look he called a groom to take us to our boxes, and invited John to take some refreshment. (4) We were taken to a light, airy stable, and placed in boxes adjoining each other, where we were rubbed down and fed. (5) In about half an hour John and Mr. York, who was to be our new coachman, came in to see us. (6) “Now, Mr. Manly,” he said, after carefully looking at us both, “I can see no fault in these horses; but we all know that horses have their peculiarities as well as men, and that sometimes they need different treatment. (7) I should like to know if there is anything particular in either of these that you would like to mention.”



“Well,” said John, “I don't believe there is a better pair of horses in the country, and right grieved I am to part with them, but they are not alike. (8) The black one is the most perfect temper I ever knew; I suppose he has never known a hard word or a blow since he was foaled, and all his pleasure seems to be to do what you wish; but the chestnut, I fancy, must have had bad treatment; we heard as much from the dealer. (9) She came to us snappish and suspicious, but when she found what sort of place ours was, it all went off by degrees; for three years I have never seen the smallest sign of temper, and if she is well treated there is not a better, more willing animal than she is. (10) But she is naturally a more irritable constitution than the black horse; flies tease her more; anything wrong in the harness frets her more; and if she were ill-used or unfairly treated she would not be unlikely to give tit for tat. (11) You know that many high-mettled horses will do so.”



“Of course,” said York, “I quite understand; but you know it is not easy in stables like these to have all the grooms just what they should be. (12) I do my best, and there I must leave it. (13) I'll remember what you have said about the mare.”



They were going out of the stable, when John stopped and said, “I had better mention that we have never used the check-rein with either of them; the black horse never had one on, and the dealer said it was the gag-bit that spoiled the other's temper.”



“Well,” said York, “if they come here they must wear the check-rein. (14) I prefer a loose rein myself, and his lordship is always very reasonable about horses; but my lady—that's another thing; she will have style, and if her carriage horses are not reined up tight she wouldn't look at them. (15) I always stand out against the gag-bit, and shall do so, but it must be tight up when my lady rides!”



“I am sorry for it, very sorry,” said John; “but I must go now, or I shall lose the train.”



He came round to each of us to pat and speak to us for the last time; his voice sounded very sad. (16) I held my face close to him; that was all I could do to say good-by; and then he was gone, and I have never seen him since. (17) The next day Lord W—— came to look at us; he seemed pleased with our appearance. (18) “I have great confidence in these horses,” he said, “from the character my friend Mr. Gordon has given me of them. (19) Of course they are not a match in color, but my idea is that they will do very well for the carriage while we are in the country. (20) Before we go to London I must try to match Baron; the black horse, I believe, is perfect for riding.”



York then told him what John had said about us. (21) “Well,” said he, “you must keep an eye to the mare, and put the check-rein easy; I dare say they will do very well with a little humoring at first. (22) I'll mention it to your lady.”

In the afternoon we were harnessed and put in the carriage, and as the stable clock struck three we were led round to the front of the house. (23) It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion. (24) Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet breeches and white stockings. (25) Presently we heard the rustling sound of silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. (26) She stepped round to look at us; she was a tall, proud-looking woman, and did not seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the carriage. (27) This was the first time of wearing a check-rein, and I must say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed to carry it. (28) I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and content. (29) The next day at three o'clock we were again at the door, and the footmen as before; we heard the silk dress rustle and the lady came down the steps, and in an imperious voice she said, “York, you must put those horses' heads higher; they are not fit to be seen.”



York got down, and said very respectfully, “I beg your pardon, my lady, but these horses have not been reined up for three years, and my lord said it would be safer to bring them to it by degrees; but if your ladyship pleases I can take them up a little more.”



“Do so,” she said.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Meantime, you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need, and send the bills to me;” and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar, as if that matter was settled. (2) “Oh, thank you, sir! (3) That will be splendid. (4) Merry always has pretty things, and I know you will like me when I get fixed,” said Molly, smoothing down her apron, with a little air. (5) “Seems to me you look very well as you are. (6) Isn't that a pretty enough frock?” asked Mr. Bemis, quite unconscious that his own unusual interest in his daughter's affairs made her look so bright and winsome. (7) “This? (8) Why, father, I've worn it all winter, and it'sfrightfullyugly, and almost in rags. (9) I asked you for a new one a month ago, and you said you'd 'see about it'; but you didn't, so I patched this up as well as I could;” and Molly showed her elbows, feeling that such masculine blindness as this deserved a mild reproof. (10) “Too bad! (11) Well, go and get half a dozen pretty muslin and gingham things, and be as gay as a butterfly, to make up for it,” laughed her father, really touched by the patches and Molly's resignation to the unreliable “I'll see about it,” which he recognized as a household word. (12) Molly clapped her hands, old gloves and all, exclaiming, with girlish delight, “How nice it will seem to have a plenty of new, neat dresses all at once, and be like other girls! (13) Miss Bat always talks about economy, and has no more taste than a—caterpillar.” Molly meant to say “cat,” but remembering her pets, spared them the insult. (14) “I think I can afford to dress my girl as well as Grant does his. (15) Get a new hat and coat, child, and any little notions you fancy. (16) Miss Bat's economy isn't the sort I like;” and Mr. Bemis looked at his wristbands again, as if he could sympathize with Molly's elbows. (17) “At this rate, I shall have more clothes than I know what to do with, after being a rag-bag,” thought the girl, in great glee, as she bravely stitched away at the worst glove, while her father smoked silently for a while, feeling that several little matters had escaped his eye which he really ought to “see about.”



Presently he went to his desk, but not to bury himself in business papers, as usual, for, after rummaging in several drawers, he took out a small bunch of keys, and sat looking at them with an expression only seen on his face when he looked up at the portrait of a dark-eyed woman hanging in his room. (18) He was a very busy man, but he had a tender place in his heart for his children; and when a look, a few words, a moment's reflection, called his attention to the fact that his little girl was growing up, he found both pride and pleasure in the thought that this young daughter was trying to fill her mother's place, and be a comfort to him, if he would let her. (19) “Molly, my dear, here is something for you,” he said; and when she stood beside him, added, as he put the keys into her hand, keeping both in his own for a minute,—



“Those are the keys to your mother's things. (20) I always meant you to have them, when you were old enough to use or care for them. (21) I think you'll fancy this better than any other present, for you are a good child, and very like her.”



Something seemed to get into his throat there, and Molly put her arm round his neck, saying, with a little choke in her own voice, “Thank you, father, I'd rather have this than anything else in the world, and I'll try to be more like her every day, for your sake.”



He kissed her, then said, as he began to stir his papers about, “I must write some letters. (22) Run off to bed, child. (23) Good-night, my dear, good-night.”

Seeing that he wanted to be alone, Molly slipped away, feeling that she had received a very precious gift; for she remembered the dear, dead mother, and had often longed to possess the relics laid away in the one room where order reigned and Miss Bat had no power to meddle. (24) As she slowly undressed, she was not thinking of the pretty new gowns in which she was to be “as gay as a butterfly,” but of the half-worn garments waiting for her hands to unfold with a tender touch; and when she fell asleep, with the keys under her pillow and her arms round Boo, a few happy tears on her cheeks seemed to show that, in trying to do the duty which lay nearest her, she had earned a very sweet reward. (25) So the little missionaries succeeded better in their second attempt than in their first; for, though still very far from being perfect girls, each was slowly learning, in her own way, one of the three lessons all are the better for knowing—that cheerfulness can change misfortune into love and friends; that in ordering one's self aright one helps others to do the same; and that the power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Now let us see how the other missionaries got on with their tasks. (2) Farmer Grant was a thrifty, well-to-do man, anxious to give his children greater advantages than he had enjoyed, and to improve the fine place of which he was justly proud. (3) Mrs. Grant was a notable housewife, as ambitious and industrious as her husband, but too busy to spend any time on the elegancies of life, though always ready to help the poor and sick like a good neighbor and Christian woman. (4) The three sons—Tom, Dick, and Harry—were big fellows of seventeen, nineteen, and twenty-one; the first two on the farm, and the elder in a store just setting up for himself. (5) Kind-hearted but rough-mannered youths, who loved Merry very much, but teased her sadly about her “fine lady airs,” as they called her dainty ways and love of beauty. (6) Merry was a thoughtful girl, full of innocent fancies, refined tastes, and romantic dreams, in which no one sympathized at home, though she was the pet of the family. (7) It did seem, to an outsider, as if the delicate little creature had got there by mistake, for she looked very like a tea-rose in a field of clover and dandelions, whose highest aim in life was to feed cows and help make root beer. (8) When the girls talked over the new society, it pleased Merry very much, and she decided not only to try and love work better, but to convert her family to a liking for pretty things, as she called her own more cultivated tastes. (9) “I will begin at once, and show them that I don't mean to shirk my duty, though I do want to be nice,” thought she, as she sat at supper one night and looked about her, planning her first move. (10) Not a very cheering prospect for a lover of the beautiful, certainly, for the big kitchen, though as neat as wax, had nothing lovely in it, except a red geranium blooming at the window. (11) Nor were the people all that could be desired, in some respects, as they sat about the table shovelling in pork and beans with their knives, drinking tea from their saucers, and laughing out with a hearty “Haw, haw,” when anything amused them. (12) Yet the boys were handsome, strong specimens, the farmer a hale, benevolent-looking man, the housewife a pleasant, sharp-eyed matron, who seemed to find comfort in looking often at the bright face at her elbow, with the broad forehead, clear eyes, sweet mouth, and quiet voice that came like music in among the loud masculine ones, or the quick, nervous tones of a woman always in a hurry. (13) Merry's face was so thoughtful that evening that her father observed it, for, when at home, he watched her as one watches a kitten, glad to see anything so pretty, young, and happy, at its play. (14) “Little daughter has got something on her mind, I mistrust. (15) Come and tell father all about it,” he said, with a sounding slap on his broad knee as he turned his chair from the table to the ugly stove, where three pairs of wet boots steamed underneath, and a great kettle of cider apple-sauce simmered above. (16) “When I've helped clear up, I'll come and talk. (17) Now, mother, you sit down and rest; Roxy and I can do everything,” answered Merry, patting the old rocking-chair so invitingly that the tired woman could not resist, especially as watching the kettle gave her an excuse for obeying. (18) “Well, I don't care if I do, for I've been on my feet since five o'clock. (19) Be sure you cover things up, and shut the buttery door, and put the cat down cellar, and sift your meal. (20) I'll see to the buckwheats last thing before I go to bed.”



Mrs. Grant subsided with her knitting, for her hands were never idle; Tom tilted his chair back against the wall and picked his teeth with his pen-knife; Dick got out a little pot of grease, to make the boots water-tight; and Harry sat down at the small table to look over his accounts, with an important air,—for every one occupied this room, and the work was done in the out-kitchen behind. (21) Merry hated clearing up, but dutifully did every distasteful task, and kept her eye on careless Roxy till all was in order; then she gladly went to perch on her father's knee, seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the “little one.”



“Yes, I do want something, but I know you will say it is silly,” she began, as her father pinched her blooming cheek, with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well. (22) “Shouldn't wonder if it was a doll now;” and Mr. Grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile, as if she was about six instead of fifteen. (23) “Why, father, you know I don't! (24) I haven't played with dollies for years and years.

Book Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Book Author: Lewis Carroll

Paragraph: (1) “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone. (2) “Areyou to get in at all?” said the Footman. (3) “That’s the first question, you know.”

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. (4) “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. (5) It’s enough to drive one crazy!”

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. (6) “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”



“But what amIto do?” said Alice. (7) “Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling. (8) “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in. (9) The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. (10) “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. (11) There was certainly too much of it in the air. (12) Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. (13) The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. (14) “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”



“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. (15) Pig!”

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—



“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that catscouldgrin.”



“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”



“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. (16) “You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”



Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. (17) While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. (18) The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. (19) “Oh,pleasemind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. (20) “Oh, there goes hispreciousnose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. (21) “If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”



“Which wouldnotbe an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. (22) “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! (23) You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”



“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”



Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, Ithink; or is it twelve? (24) I—”

“Oh, don’t botherme,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:



“Speak roughly to your little boy,And beat him when he sneezes:He only does it to annoy,Because he knows it teases.”



CHORUS. (25) (In which the cook and the baby joined):

“Wow! (26) wow! (27) wow!”

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—



“I speak severely to my boy,I beat him when he sneezes;For he can thoroughly enjoyThe pepper when he pleases!”



CHORUS. (28) “Wow! (29) wow! (30) wow!”

“Here!

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?”



He looked very much offended, and said:



“Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to ride. (2) When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they are all right I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the best riding-master those children have. (3) It is not them, it is the boys; boys,” said he, shaking his mane, “are quite different; they must be broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what. (4) The other children had ridden me about for nearly two hours, and then the boys thought it was their turn, and so it was, and I was quite agreeable. (5) They rode me by turns, and I galloped them about, up and down the fields and all about the orchard, for a good hour. (6) They had each cut a great hazel stick for a riding-whip, and laid it on a little too hard; but I took it in good part, till at last I thought we had had enough, so I stopped two or three times by way of a hint. (7) Boys, you see, think a horse or pony is like a steam-engine or a thrashing-machine, and can go on as long and as fast as they please; they never think that a pony can get tired, or have any feelings; so as the one who was whipping me could not understand I just rose up on my hind legs and let him slip off behind—that was all. (8) He mounted me again, and I did the same. (9) Then the other boy got up, and as soon as he began to use his stick I laid him on the grass, and so on, till they were able to understand—that was all. (10) They are not bad boys; they don't wish to be cruel. (11) I like them very well; but you see I had to give them a lesson. (12) When they brought me to James and told him I think he was very angry to see such big sticks. (13) He said they were only fit for drovers or gypsies, and not for young gentlemen.”



“If I had been you,” said Ginger, “I would have given those boys a good kick, and that would have given them a lesson.”



“No doubt you would,” said Merrylegs; “but then I am not quite such a fool (begging your pardon) as to anger our master or make James ashamed of me. (14) Besides, those children are under my charge when they are riding; I tell you they are intrusted to me. (15) Why, only the other day I heard our master say to Mrs. Blomefield, 'My dear madam, you need not be anxious about the children; my old Merrylegs will take as much care of them as you or I could; I assure you I would not sell that pony for any money, he is so perfectly good-tempered and trustworthy;' and do you think I am such an ungrateful brute as to forget all the kind treatment I have had here for five years, and all the trust they place in me, and turn vicious because a couple of ignorant boys used me badly? (16) No, no! (17) you never had a good place where they were kind to you, and so you don't know, and I'm sorry for you; but I can tell you good places make good horses. (18) I wouldn't vex our people for anything; I love them, I do,” said Merrylegs, and he gave a low “ho, ho, ho!” through his nose, as he used to do in the morning when he heard James' footstep at the door. (19) “Besides,” he went on, “if I took to kicking where should I be? (20) Why, sold off in a jiffy, and no character, and I might find myself slaved about under a butcher's boy, or worked to death at some seaside place where no one cared for me, except to find out how fast I could go, or be flogged along in some cart with three or four great men in it going out for a Sunday spree, as I have often seen in the place I lived in before I came here; no,” said he, shaking his head, “I hope I shall never come to that.”

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies.”



“The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,” put in Pestsov. (2) “Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general principles.”



“I cannot quite agree with that,” responded Alexey Alexandrovitch. (3) “It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development. (4) Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.”



Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass. (5) He began warmly contesting the justice of this view. (6) Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing reply ready. (7) “But,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin, “One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral—disons le mot—anti-nihilist influence.”



“Undoubtedly.”





“If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,” said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, “we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies. (8) But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... (9) But what if they had no such medicinal property?” he wound up humorously. (10) At Sergey Ivanovitch’s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found something to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to conversation. (11) Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. (12) With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant. (13) Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest, Pestsov promptly started a new one. (14) “I can’t agree even,” said he, “that the government had that aim. (15) The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. (16) The education of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.”



And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women. (17) Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous. (18) “I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably connected together,” said Pestsov; “it is a vicious circle. (19) Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights. (20) We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us,” said he. (21) “You said rights,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had finished, “meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service, of sitting in parliament....”



“Undoubtedly.”





“But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression ‘rights.’ It would be more correct to say duties. (22) Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties. (23) And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately. (24) And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man.”



“Quite so,” Alexey Alexandrovitch assented. (25) “The question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.”



“They will most likely be perfectly fitted,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “when education has become general among them. (26) We see this....”

“How about the proverb?” said the prince, who had a long while been intent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling. (27) “I can say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is....”



“Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!” said Pestsov angrily. (28) “What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to avoid them.”



“Duties are bound up with rights—power, money, honor; those are what women are seeking,” said Pestsov. (29) “Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take me,” said the old prince. (30) Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) She vented her feelings in a bray, which Grif imitated, convulsing all hearers by the sound as well as by the wink the one eye gave, and the droll waggle of one erect ear, while the other pointed straight forward. (2) The girls laughed so at the ridiculous sight that they nearly fell over the railing, and the boys were in ecstasies, especially when Grif, emboldened by his success, trotted briskly round the race-course, followed by the cheers of the crowd. (3) Excited by the noise, Graciosa did her best, till the false head, loosened by the rapid motion, slipped round under her nose, causing her to stop so suddenly that Grif flew off, alighting on his own head with a violence which would have killed any other boy. (4) Sobered by his downfall, he declined to mount again, but led his steed to repose in a shed, while he rejoined his friends, who were waiting impatiently to congratulate him on his latest and best prank. (5) The Committee went their rounds soon after, and, when the doors were again opened, every one hurried to see if their articles had received a premium. (6) A card lay on the butter cups, and Mrs. Grant was full of pride becauseherbutter always took a prize, and this proved that Merry was walking in her mother's steps, in this direction at least. (7) Another card swung from the blue quilt, for the kindly judges knew who made it, and were glad to please the little girl, though several others as curious but not so pretty hung near by. (8) The cats were admired, but, as they were not among the animals usually exhibited, there was no prize awarded. (9) Gus hoped his hens would get one; but somebody else outdid him, to the great indignation of Laura and Lotty, who had fed the white biddies faithfully for months. (10) Jack was sure his rabbit was the biggest there, and went eagerly to look for his premium. (11) But neither card nor Bun were to be seen, for the old rascal had escaped for the last time, and was never seen again; which was a great comfort to Jack, who was heartily tired of him. (12) Ralph's bust was the best of all, for not only did it get a prize, and was much admired, but a lady, who found Jill and Merry rejoicing over it, was so pleased with the truth and grace of the little head, that she asked about the artist, and whether he would do one of her own child, who was so delicate she feared he might not live long. (13) Merry gladly told the story of her ambitious friend, and went to find him, that he might secure the order. (14) While she was gone, Jill took up the tale, gratefully telling how kind he had been to her, how patiently he worked and waited, and how much he longed to go abroad. (15) Fortunately the lady was rich and generous, as well as fond of art, and being pleased with the bust, and interested in the young sculptor, gave him the order when he came, and filled his soul with joy by adding, that, if it suited her when done, it should be put into marble. (16) She lived in the city, and Ralph soon arranged his work so that he could give up his noon hour, and go to model the child; for every penny he could earn or save now was very precious, as he still hoped to go abroad. (17) The girls were so delighted with this good fortune, that they did not stay for the races, but went home to tell the happy news, leaving the boys to care for the cats, and enjoy the various matches to come off that day. (18) “I'm so glad I tried to look pleasant when I was lying on the board while Ralph did my head, for the pleasantness got into the clay face, and that made the lady like it,” said Jill, as she lay resting on the sofa. (19) “I always thought it was a dear, bright little face, but now I love and admire it more than ever,” cried Merry, kissing it gratefully, as she remembered the help and pleasure it had given Ralph.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Gerty and Wally nodded to her, and their pretty mamma was so kind and so gay, that Jill could not feel bashful after the first few minutes, and soon looked about her, sure of seeing friendly faces everywhere. (2) Frank and Jack ate as if the salt air had already improved their appetites, and talked about Bacon and Cox as if they had been bosom friends for years. (3) Mamma was as happy as they, for her friend, Mrs. Hammond, sat close by; and this rosy lady, who had been a physician, cheered her up by predicting that Jill would soon be running about as well as ever. (4) But the best of all was in the evening, when the elder people gathered in the parlors and played Twenty Questions, while the children looked on for an hour before going to bed, much amused at the sight of grown people laughing, squabbling, dodging, and joking as if they had all become young again; for, as every one knows, it is impossible to help lively skirmishes when that game is played. (5) Jill lay in the sofa corner enjoying it all immensely; for she never saw anything so droll, and found it capital fun to help guess the thing, or try to puzzle the opposite side. (6) Her quick wits and bright face attracted people, and in the pauses of the sport she held quite a levee, for everybody was interested in the little invalid. (7) The girls shyly made friends in their own way, the mammas told thrilling tales of the accidents their darlings had survived, several gentlemen kindly offered their boats, and the boys, with the best intentions in life, suggested strolls of two or three miles to Rafe's Chasm and Norman's Woe, or invited her to tennis and archery, as if violent exercise was the cure for all human ills. (8) She was very grateful, and reluctantly went away to bed, declaring, when she got upstairs, that these new friends were the dearest people she ever met, and the Willows the most delightful place in the whole world. (9) Next day a new life began for the young folks—a very healthy, happy life; and all threw themselves into it so heartily, that it was impossible to help getting great good from it, for these summer weeks, if well spent, work miracles in tired bodies and souls. (10) Frank took a fancy to the bicycle boy, and, being able to hire one of the breakneck articles, soon learned to ride it; and the two might be seen wildly working their long legs on certain smooth stretches of road, or getting up their muscle rowing about the bay till they were almost as brown and nautical in appearance and language as the fishermen who lived in nooks and corners along the shore. (11) Jack struck up a great friendship with the sturdy Bacon and the agreeable Cox: the latter, being about his own age, was his especial favorite; and they soon were called Box and Cox by the other fellows, which did not annoy them a bit, as both had played parts in that immortal farce. (12) They had capital times fishing, scrambling over the rocks, playing ball and tennis, and rainy days they took possession of the studio opposite, drew up the portcullis, and gallantly defended the castle, which some of the others besieged with old umbrellas for shields, bats for battering-rams, and bunches of burrs for cannon-balls. (13) Great larks went on over there, while the girls applauded from the piazza or chamber-windows, and made a gay flag for the victors to display from the tower when the fight was over. (14) But Jill had the best time of all, for each day brought increasing strength and spirits, and she improved so fast it was hard to believe that she was the same girl who lay so long almost helpless in the Bird Room at home. (15) Such lively letters as she sent her mother, all about her new friends, her fine sails, drives, and little walks; the good times she had in the evening, the lovely things people gave her, and she was learning to make with shells and sea-weed, and what splendid fun it was to keep house in a boat. (16) This last amusement soon grew quite absorbing, and her “cubby,” as she called it, rapidly became a pretty grotto, where she lived like a little mermaid, daily loving more and more the beauty of the wonderful sea. (17) Finding the boat too sunny at times, the boys cut long willow boughs and arched them over the seats, laying hemlock branches across till a green roof made it cool and shady inside. (18) There Jill sat or lay among her cushions reading, trying to sketch, sorting shells, drying gay sea-weeds, or watching her crabs, jelly-fish, and anemones in the old boiler, now buried in sand and edged about with moss from the woods. (19) Nobody disturbed her treasures, but kindly added to them, and often when she went to her nest she found fruit or flowers, books or bon-bons, laid ready for her. (20) Every one pitied and liked the bright little girl who could not run and frisk with the rest, who was so patient and cheerful after her long confinement, ready to help others, and so grateful for any small favor. (21) She found now that the weary months had not been wasted, and was very happy to discover in herself a new sort of strength and sweetness that was not only a comfort to her, but made those about her love and trust her. (22) The songs she had learned attracted the babies, who would leave their play to peep at her and listen when she sung over her work. (23) Passers-by paused to hear the blithe voice of the bird in the green cage, and other invalids, strolling on the beach, would take heart when they saw the child so happy in spite of her great trial. (24) The boys kept all their marine curiosities for her, and were always ready to take her a row or a sail, as the bay was safe and that sort of travelling suited her better than driving. (25) But the girls had capital times together, and it did Jill good to see another sort from those she knew at home. (26) She had been so much petted of late, that she was getting rather vain of her small accomplishments, and being with strangers richer, better bred and educated than herself, made her more humble in some things, while it showed her the worth of such virtues as she could honestly claim. (27) Mamie Cox took her to drive in the fine carriage of her mamma, and Jill was much impressed by the fact that Mamie was not a bit proud about it, and did not put on any airs, though she had a maid to take care of her. (28) Gerty wore pretty costumes, and came down with pink and blue ribbons in her hair that Jill envied very much; yet Gerty liked her curls, and longed to have some, while her mother, “the lady from Philadelphia,” as they called her, was so kind and gay that Jill quite adored her, and always felt as if sunshine had come into the room when she entered. (29) Two little sisters were very interesting to her, and made her long for one of her own when she saw them going about together and heard them talk of their pleasant home, where the great silk factories were. (30) But they invited her to come and see the wonderful cocoons, and taught her to knot pretty gray fringe on a cushion, which delighted her, being so new and easy.

Book Title: Grimms' Fairy Tales

Book Author: Jacob Grimm

Paragraph: (1) But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. (2) And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone. (3) Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. (4) Then she dressed herself up as a peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’ ‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? (5) Do you think it is poisoned? (6) Come! (7) do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. (8) Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. (9) But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. (10) ‘This time nothing will save thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:



And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. (11) When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. (12) They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. (13) So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king’s daughter. (14) And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. (15) And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side. (16) And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. (17) At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. (18) Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe with me.’



Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding. (19) To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:



And the glass answered:



When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. (20) And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Isn't that fun?” laughed Molly, in high glee, at the agreeable change. (2) “I like it ever so much, but I don't want to stay so all my days. (3) I mean to travel, and just as soon as I can I shall take Boo and go all round the world, and see everything,” she added, waving her gay sack, as if it were the flag she was about to nail to the masthead of her ship. (4) “Well, I should like to be famous in some way, and have people admire me very much. (5) I'd like to act, or dance, or sing, or be what I heard the ladies at Pebbly Beach call a 'queen of society.' (6) But I don't expect to be anything, and I'm not going to worry I shallnotbe a Lucinda, so I ought to be contented and happy all my life,” said Jill, who was very ambitious in spite of the newly acquired meekness, which was all the more becoming because her natural liveliness often broke out like sunshine through a veil of light clouds. (7) If the three girls could have looked forward ten years they would have been surprised to see how different a fate was theirs from the one each had chosen, and how happy each was in the place she was called to fill. (8) Merry was not making the old farmhouse pretty, but living in Italy, with a young sculptor for her husband, and beauty such as she never dreamed of all about her. (9) Molly was not travelling round the world, but contentedly keeping house for her father and still watching over Boo, who was becoming her pride and joy as well as care. (10) Neither was Jill a famous woman, but a very happy and useful one, with the two mothers leaning on her as they grew old, the young men better for her influence over them, many friends to love and honor her, and a charming home, where she was queen by right of her cheery spirit, grateful heart, and unfailing devotion to those who had made her what she was. (11) If any curious reader, not content with this peep into futurity, asks, “Did Molly and Jill ever marry?” we must reply, for the sake of peace—Molly remained a merry spinster all her days, one of the independent, brave, and busy creatures of whom there is such need in the world to help take care of other peoples' wives and children, and do the many useful jobs that the married folk have no time for. (12) Jill certainly did wear a white veil on the day she was twenty-five and called her husband Jack. (13) Further than that we cannot go, except to say that this leap did not end in a catastrophe, like the first one they took together. (14) That day, however, they never dreamed of what was in store for them, but chattered away as they cleared up the room, and then ran off ready for play, feeling that they had earned it by work well done. (15) They found the lads just finishing, with Boo to help by picking up the windfalls for the cider-heap, after he had amused himself by putting about a bushel down the various holes old Bun had left behind him. (16) Jack was risking his neck climbing in the most dangerous places, while Frank, with a long-handled apple-picker, nipped off the finest fruit with care, both enjoying the pleasant task and feeling proud of the handsome red and yellow piles all about the little orchard. (17) Merry and Molly caught up baskets and fell to work with all their might, leaving Jill to sit upon a stool and sort the early apples ready to use at once, looking up now and then to nod and smile at her mother who watched her from the window, rejoicing to see her lass so well and happy. (18) It was such a lovely day, they all felt its cheerful influence; for the sun shone bright and warm, the air was full of an invigorating freshness which soon made the girls' faces look like rosy apples, and their spirits as gay as if they had been stealing sips of new cider through a straw. (19) Jack whistled like a blackbird as he swung and bumped about, Frank orated and joked, Merry and Molly ran races to see who would fill and empty fastest, and Jill sung to Boo, who reposed in a barrel, exhausted with his labors. (20) “These are the last of the pleasant days, and we ought to make the most of them. (21) Let's have one more picnic before the frost spoils the leaves,” said Merry, resting a minute at the gate to look down the street, which was a glorified sort of avenue, with brilliant maples lining the way and carpeting the ground with crimson and gold. (22) “Oh, yes! (23) Go down the river once more and have supper on the Island. (24) I couldn't go to some of your picnics, and I do long for a last good time before winter shuts me up again,” cried Jill, eager to harvest all the sunshine she could, for she was not yet quite her old self again. (25) “I'm your man, if the other fellows agree. (26) We can't barrel these up for a while, so to-morrow will be a holiday for us. (27) Better make sure of the day while you can, this weather can't last long;” and Frank shook his head like one on intimate terms with Old Prob. (28) “Don't worry about those high ones, Jack. (29) Give a shake and come down and plan about the party,” called Molly, throwing up a big Baldwin with what seemed a remarkably good aim, for a shower of apples followed, and a boy came tumbling earthward to catch on the lowest bough and swing down like a caterpillar, exclaiming, as he landed,—



“I'm glad that job is done!

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Then I'll show you about darning the tablecloths. (2) I do hate to have a stitch of work left over till Monday,” said Mrs. Grant, who never took naps, and prided herself on sitting down to her needle at 3 P.M. every day. (3) “Yes, mother;” and Merry went slowly upstairs, feeling that a part of Saturday ought to be a holiday after books and work all the week. (4) As she braided up her hair, her eye fell upon the reflection of her own face in the glass. (5) Not a happy nor a pretty one just then, and Merry was so unaccustomed to seeing any other, that involuntarily the frown smoothed itself out, the eyes lost their weary look, the drooping lips curved into a smile, and, leaning her elbows on the bureau, she shook her head at herself, saying, half aloud, as she glanced at Ivanhoe lying near,—



“You needn't look so cross and ugly just because you can't have what you want. (6) Sweeping, baking, and darning are not so bad as being plagued with lovers and carried off and burnt at the stake, so I won't envy poor Rebecca her jewels and curls and romantic times, but make the best of my own.”



Then she laughed, and the bright face came back into the mirror, looking like an old friend, and Merry went on dressing with care, for she took pleasure in her own little charms, and felt a sense of comfort in knowing that she could always have one pretty thing to look at if she kept her own face serene and sweet. (7) It certainly looked so as it bent over the pile of big socks half an hour later, and brightened with each that was laid aside. (8) Her mother saw it, and, guessing why such wistful glances went from clock to window, kindly shortened the task of table-cloth darning by doing a good bit herself, before putting it into Merry's hands. (9) She was a good and loving mother in spite of her strict ways, and knew that it was better for her romantic daughter to be learning all the housewifery lessons she could teach her, than to be reading novels, writing verses, or philandering about with her head full of girlish fancies, quite innocent in themselves, but not the stuff to live on. (10) So she wisely taught the hands that preferred to pick flowers, trim up rooms and mould birds, to work well with needle, broom, and rolling-pin; put a receipt-book before the eyes that loved to laugh and weep over tender tales, and kept the young head and heart safe and happy with wholesome duties, useful studies, and such harmless pleasures as girls should love, instead of letting them waste their freshness in vague longings, idle dreams, and frivolous pastimes. (11) But it was often hard to thwart the docile child, and lately she had seemed to be growing up so fast that her mother began to feel a new sort of tenderness for this sweet daughter, who was almost ready to take upon herself the cares, as well as triumphs and delights, of maidenhood. (12) Something in the droop of the brown head, and the quick motion of the busy hand with a little burn on it, made it difficult for Mrs. Grant to keep Merry at work that day, and her eye watched the clock almost as impatiently as the girl's, for she liked to see the young face brighten when the hour of release came. (13) “What next?” asked Merry, as the last stitch was set, and she stifled a sigh on hearing the clock strike four, for the sun was getting low, and the lovely afternoon going fast. (14) “One more job, if you are not too tired for it. (15) I want the receipt for diet drink Miss Dawes promised me; would you like to run down and get it for me, dear?”



“Yes, mother!” and that answer was as blithe as a robin's chirp, for that was just where Merry wanted to go. (16) Away went thimble and scissors, and in five minutes away went Merry, skipping down the hill without a care in the world, for a happy heart sat singing within, and everything seemed full of beauty. (17) She had a capital time with Molly, called on Jill, did her shopping in the village, and had just turned to walk up the hill, when Ralph Evans came tramping along behind her, looking so pleased and proud about something that she could not help asking what it was, for they were great friends, and Merry thought that to be an artist was the most glorious career a man could choose. (18) “I know you've got some good news,” she said, looking up at him as he touched his hat and fell into step with her, seeming more contented than before. (19) “I have, and was just coming up to tell you, for I was sure you would be glad. (20) It is only a hope, a chance, but it is so splendid I feel as if I must shout and dance, or fly over a fence or two, to let off steam.”



“Do tell me, quick; have you got an order?” asked Merry, full of interest at once, for artistic vicissitudes were very romantic, and she liked to hear about them. (21) “I may go abroad in the autumn.”

“Oh, how lovely!”



“Isn't it? (22) David German is going to spend a year in Rome, to finish a statue, and wants me to go along. (23) Grandma is willing, as cousin Maria wants her for a long visit, so everything looks promising and I really think I may go.”



“Won't it cost a great deal?” asked Merry, who, in spite of her little elegancies, had a good deal of her thrifty mother's common sense. (24) “Yes; and I've got to earn it. (25) But I can—I know I can, for I've saved some, and I shall work like ten beavers all summer. (26) I won't borrow if I can help it, but I know someone who would lend me five hundred if I wanted it;” and Ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks. (27) “I wish I had it to give you. (28) It must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance. (29) And to travel, and see all the lovely pictures and statues, and people and places in Italy.
