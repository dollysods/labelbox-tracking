Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) It was silly of me to come down here at all. (2) I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready. (3) On a yacht one is safe.”

“Safe from what, Dorian? (4) You are in some trouble. (5) Why not tell me what it is? (6) You know I would help you.”

“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. (7) “And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine. (8) This unfortunate accident has upset me. (9) I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”



“What nonsense!”



“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. (10) Ah! (11) here is the duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. (12) You see we have come back, Duchess.”

“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. (13) “Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset. (14) And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare. (15) How curious!”

“Yes, it was very curious. (16) I don’t know what made me say it. (17) Some whim, I suppose. (18) It looked the loveliest of little live things. (19) But I am sorry they told you about the man. (20) It is a hideous subject.”

“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. (21) “It has no psychological value at all. (22) Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose, how interesting he would be! (23) I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder.”



“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. (24) “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray? (25) Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again.

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”



I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. (2) My pride forbade me to ask any questions. (3) Poirot switched off on another tack. (4) “Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? (5) How was that?”

“She is at the hospital again. (6) She resumed work to-day.”

“Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. (7) And pretty too. (8) She is like pictures I have seen in Italy. (9) I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers. (10) Do you think she would show it to me?”

“I am sure she would be delighted. (11) It’s an interesting little place.”

“Does she go there every day?”



“She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays. (12) Those are her only times off.”

“I will remember. (13) Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle Cynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”



“Yes. (14) I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”

“Without doubt. (15) After all, it is very responsible work. (16) I suppose they have very strong poisons there?”

“Yes, she showed them to us. (17) They are kept locked up in a little cupboard. (18) I believe they have to be very careful. (19) They always take out the key before leaving the room.”



“Indeed. (20) It is near the window, this cupboard?”

“No, right the other side of the room. (21) Why?”

Poirot shrugged his shoulders. (22) “I wondered. (23) That is all. (24) Will you come in?”

We had reached the cottage. (25) “No.

Book Title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) “Oh, clever as the devil! (2) I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday. (3) You never saw such a spectacle!” And I described the doctor’s adventure. (4) “He looked a regular scarecrow! (5) Plastered with mud from head to foot.”

“You saw him, then?”



“Yes. (6) Of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.”



“What?” Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. (7) “Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? (8) Here? (9) And you never told me? (10) Why did you not tell me? (11) Why? (12) Why?”

He appeared to be in an absolute frenzy. (13) “My dear Poirot,” I expostulated, “I never thought it would interest you. (14) I didn’t know it was of any importance.”

“Importance? (15) It is of the first importance! (16) So Dr. Bauerstein was here on Tuesday night—the night of the murder. (17) Hastings, do you not see? (18) That alters everything—everything!”

I had never seen him so upset. (19) Loosening his hold of me, he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: “Yes, that alters everything—everything.”



Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision. (20) “Allons!” he said. (21) “We must act at once. (22) Where is Mr. Cavendish?”

John was in the smoking-room. (23) Poirot went straight to him. (24) “Mr. (25) Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster.

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) ""What is it?"". (2) I repeated, and for the first time during our acquaintance I kissed her hand. (3) ""No, it's nothing, nothing,"" she said quickly. (4) ""Oh, it's nothing, nothing.... Go away.... You see, I am not dressed."". (5) I went out overwhelmed. (6) The calm and serene mood in which I had been for so long was poisoned by compassion. (7) I had a passionate longing to fall at her feet, to entreat her not to weep in solitude, but to share her grief with me, and the monotonous murmur of the sea already sounded a gloomy prophecy in my ears, and I foresaw fresh tears, fresh troubles, and fresh losses in the future. (8) ""What is she crying about? (9) What is it?"". (10) I wondered, recalling her face and her agonised look. (11) I remembered she was with child. (12) She tried to conceal her condition from other people, and also from herself. (13) At home she went about in a loose wrapper or in a blouse with extremely full folds over the bosom, and when she went out anywhere she laced herself in so tightly that on two occasions she fainted when we were out. (14) She never spoke to me of her condition, and when I hinted that it might be as well to see a doctor, she flushed crimson and said not a word. (15) When I went to see her next time she was already dressed and had her hair done. (16) ""There, there,"" I said, seeing that she was ready to cry again. (17) ""We had better go to the sea and have a talk."". (18) ""I can't talk. (19) Forgive me, I am in the mood now when one wants to be alone. (20) And, if you please, Vladimir Ivanitch, another time you want to come into my room, be so good as to give a knock at the door."". (21) That ""be so good"" had a peculiar, unfeminine sound. (22) I went away. (23) My accursed Petersburg mood came back, and all my dreams were crushed and crumpled up like leaves by the heat. (24) I felt I was alone again and there was no nearness between us. (25) I was no more to her than that cobweb to that palm-tree, which hangs on it by chance and which will be torn off and carried away by the wind.

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) ""Is there nothing you wish for?"". (2) resumed the king, who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her. (3) ""Oh, you dear papa! (4) yes,"" answered she. (5) ""What is it, my darling?"". (6) ""I have been longing for it—oh, such a time! (7) ever since last night."". (8) ""Tell me what it is."". (9) ""Will you promise to let me have it?"". (10) The king was on the point of saying Yes, but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head. (11) ""Tell me what it is first,"" said he. (12) ""No no. (13) Promise first."". (14) ""I dare not. (15) What is it?"". (16) ""Mind, I hold you to your promise. (17) It is—to be tied to the end of a string—a very long string indeed, and be flown like a kite. (18) Oh, such fun! (19) I would rain rose-water, and hail sugar-plums, and snow whipped-cream, and—and—and—""



A fit of laughing checked her; and she would have been off again over the floor, had not the king started up and caught her just in time. (20) Seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her, he rang the bell, and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting. (21) ""Now, queen,"" he said, turning to her Majesty, ""what IS to be done?"". (22) ""There is but one thing left,"" answered she. (23) ""Let us consult the college of Metaphysicians."". (24) ""Bravo!"". (25) cried the king; ""we will."". (26) Now at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese philosophers-by name Hum-Drum, and Kopy-Keck. (27) For them the king sent; and straightway they came.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) There were five wooden steps leading down. (2) It wasn't a proper cellar at all, the children thought, because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen's. (3) A bacon-rack hung under its ceiling. (4) There was wood in it, and coal. (5) Also the big cases. (6) Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother tried to open the great packing-case. (7) It was very securely nailed down. (8) “Where's the hammer?” asked Peter. (9) “That's just it,” said Mother. (10) “I'm afraid it's inside the box. (11) But there's a coal-shovel—and there's the kitchen poker.”



And with these she tried to get the case open. (12) “Let me do it,” said Peter, thinking he could do it better himself. (13) Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire, or opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string. (14) “You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,” said Roberta; “let me.”



“I wish Father was here,” said Phyllis; “he'd get it open in two shakes. (15) What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?”

“I wasn't,” said Roberta. (16) Just then the first of the long nails in the packing-case began to come out with a scrunch. (17) Then a lath was raised and then another, till all four stood up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like iron teeth in the candle-light. (18) “Hooray!” said Mother; “here are some candles—the very first thing! (19) You girls go and light them. (20) You'll find some saucers and things. (21) Just drop a little candle-grease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in it.”



“How many shall we light?”



“As many as ever you like,” said Mother, gaily. (22) “The great thing is to be cheerful. (23) Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and dormice.”



So the girls lighted candles. (24) The head of the first match flew off and stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as Roberta said, it was only a little burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable. (25) Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) “I'll write it down for you. (2) It doesn't really look at all like that except when you say it. (3) Have you a bit of pencil and the back of an envelope?” she asked. (4) The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful, sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a new page. (5) “Here,” he said, “write here.”

She wrote down “Szezcpansky,” and said:—



“That's how you write it. (6) You CALL it Shepansky.”

The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and fitted them on his nose. (7) When he had read the name, he looked quite different. (8) “THAT man? (9) Bless my soul!” he said. (10) “Why, I've read his book! (11) It's translated into every European language. (12) A fine book—a noble book. (13) And so your mother took him in—like the good Samaritan. (14) Well, well. (15) I'll tell you what, youngsters—your mother must be a very good woman.”



“Of course she is,” said Phyllis, in astonishment. (16) “And you're a very good man,” said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly resolved to be polite. (17) “You flatter me,” said the old gentleman, taking off his hat with a flourish. (18) “And now am I to tell you what I think of you?”

“Oh, please don't,” said Bobbie, hastily. (19) “Why?” asked the old gentleman. (20) “I don't exactly know,” said Bobbie. (21) “Only—if it's horrid, I don't want you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't.”



The old gentleman laughed. (22) “Well, then,” he said, “I'll only just say that I'm very glad you came to me about this—very glad, indeed. (23) And I shouldn't be surprised if I found out something very soon. (24) I know a great many Russians in London, and every Russian knows HIS name. (25) Now tell me all about yourselves.”

He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that was Peter.

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) Health is worth more than two thousand roubles!"". (2) ""It's not the two thousand I regret,"" answered the lady, and a big tear rolled down her cheek. (3) ""It's the fact itself that revolts me! (4) I cannot put up with thieves in my house. (5) I don't regret it—I regret nothing; but to steal from me is such ingratitude! (6) That's how they repay me for my kindness...."". (7) They all looked into their plates, but Mashenka fancied after the lady's words that every one was looking at her. (8) A lump rose in her throat; she began crying and put her handkerchief to her lips. (9) ""Pardon,"" she muttered. (10) ""I can't help it. (11) My head aches. (12) I'll go away."". (13) And she got up from the table, scraping her chair awkwardly, and went out quickly, still more overcome with confusion. (14) ""It's beyond everything!"". (15) said Nikolay Sergeitch, frowning. (16) ""What need was there to search her room? (17) How out of place it was!"". (18) ""I don't say she took the brooch,"" said Fedosya Vassilyevna, ""but can you answer for her? (19) To tell the truth, I haven't much confidence in these learned paupers."". (20) ""It really was unsuitable, Fenya.... (21) Excuse me, Fenya, but you've no kind of legal right to make a search."". (22) ""I know nothing about your laws. (23) All I know is that I've lost my brooch. (24) And I will find the brooch!"". (25) She brought her fork down on the plate with a clatter, and her eyes flashed angrily. (26) ""And you eat your dinner, and don't interfere in what doesn't concern you! (27) "".

Book Title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) “Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp? (2) It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe. (3) It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which tells you another name——”



“No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. (4) “Don’t say it! (5) Oh, don’t say it! (6) It isn’t true! (7) It can’t be true. (8) I don’t know what put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”



“I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot. (9) “Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. (10) But it can’t be so—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. (11) Itmustbe Alfred Inglethorp.”

Poirot shook his head gravely. (12) “Don’t ask me about it,” continued Miss Howard, “because I shan’t tell you. (13) I won’t admit it, even to myself. (14) I must be mad to think of such a thing.”

Poirot nodded, as if satisfied. (15) “I will ask you nothing. (16) It is enough for me that it is as I thought. (17) And I—I, too, have an instinct. (18) We are working together towards a common end.”

“Don’t ask me to help you, because I won’t. (19) I wouldn’t lift a finger to—to——” She faltered. (20) “You will help me in spite of yourself. (21) I ask you nothing—but you will be my ally. (22) You will not be able to help yourself. (23) You will do the only thing that I want of you.”

“And that is?”



“You will watch!”



Evelyn Howard bowed her head. (24) “Yes, I can’t help doing that. (25) I am always watching—always hoping I shall be proved wrong.”



“If we are wrong, well and good,” said Poirot.

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) I can't get used to it. (2) So many memories! (3) I thought we should talk without stopping till morning."". (4) Now he saw her face near, her shining eyes, and in the darkness she looked younger than in the room, and even her old childish expression seemed to have come back to her. (5) And indeed she was looking at him with naïve curiosity, as though she wanted to get a closer view and understanding of the man who had loved her so ardently, with such tenderness, and so unsuccessfully; her eyes thanked him for that love. (6) And he remembered all that had been, every minute detail; how he had wandered about the cemetery, how he had returned home in the morning exhausted, and he suddenly felt sad and regretted the past. (7) A warmth began glowing in his heart. (8) ""Do you remember how I took you to the dance at the club?"". (9) he asked. (10) ""It was dark and rainy then ..."". (11) The warmth was glowing now in his heart, and he longed to talk, to rail at life.... (12) ""Ech!"". (13) he said with a sigh. (14) ""You ask how I am living. (15) How do we live here? (16) Why, not at all. (17) We grow old, we grow stout, we grow slack. (18) Day after day passes; life slips by without colour, without expressions, without thoughts.... (19) In the daytime working for gain, and in the evening the club, the company of card-players, alcoholic, raucous-voiced gentlemen whom I can't endure. (20) What is there nice in it?"". (21) ""Well, you have work—a noble object in life. (22) You used to be so fond of talking of your hospital. (23) I was such a queer girl then; I imagined myself such a great pianist. (24) Nowadays all young ladies play the piano, and I played, too, like everybody else, and there was nothing special about me. (25) I am just such a pianist as my mother is an authoress. (26) And of course I didn't understand you then, but afterwards in Moscow I often thought of you.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) ""Mr. Brooke. (2) I call him 'John' now; we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it."". (3) ""Oh, dear! (4) I know you'll take his part: he's been good to father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. (5) Mean thing! (6) to go petting papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into liking him;"" and Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak. (7) ""My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened. (8) John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor father that we couldn't help getting fond of him. (9) He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. (10) He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could. (11) He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him; but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so young."". (12) ""Of course not; it would be idiotic! (13) I knew there was mischief brewing; I felt it; and now it's worse than I imagined. (14) I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."". (15) This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile; but she said gravely, ""Jo, I confide in you, and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. (16) When John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings toward him."". (17) ""She'll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will be all up with her. (18) She's got such a soft heart, it will melt like butter in the sun if any one looks sentimentally at her. (19) She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cosy times together. (20) I see it all! (21) they'll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good to me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and everything will be abominably uncomfortable. (22) Oh, dear me! (23) why weren't we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."". (24) Jo leaned her chin on her knees, in a disconsolate attitude, and shook her fist at the reprehensible John. (25) Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up with an air of relief.

Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. (2) I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”



“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. (3) But you must come and sit to me yourself again. (4) I can’t get on without you.”

“I can never sit to you again, Basil. (5) It is impossible!” he exclaimed, starting back. (6) The painter stared at him. (7) “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. (8) “Do you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? (9) Where is it? (10) Why have you pulled the screen in front of it? (11) Let me look at it. (12) It is the best thing I have ever done. (13) Do take the screen away, Dorian. (14) It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. (15) I felt the room looked different as I came in.”

“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. (16) You don’t imagine I let him arrange my room for me? (17) He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that is all. (18) No; I did it myself. (19) The light was too strong on the portrait.”

“Too strong! (20) Surely not, my dear fellow? (21) It is an admirable place for it. (22) Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room. (23) A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between the painter and the screen. (24) “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you must not look at it. (25) I don’t wish you to.”

“Not look at my own work!

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) The princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them. (2) When they came to the surface, she found that, for a moment or two, she could not even laugh, for she had gone down with such a rush, that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath. (3) The instant they reached the surface—

""How do you like falling in?"". (4) said the prince. (5) After some effort the princess panted out,—

""Is that what you call FALLING IN?"". (6) ""Yes,"" answered the prince, ""I should think it a very tolerable specimen."". (7) ""It seemed to me like going up,"" rejoined she. (8) ""My feeling was certainly one of elevation too,"" the prince conceded. (9) The princess did not appear to understand him, for she retorted his question:—



""How do YOU like falling in?"". (10) said the princess. (11) ""Beyond everything,"" answered he; ""for I have fallen in with the only perfect creature I ever saw."". (12) ""No more of that: I am tired of it,"" said the princess. (13) Perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning. (14) ""Don't you like falling in then?"". (15) said the prince. (16) ""It is the most delightful fun I ever had in my life,"" answered she. (17) ""I never fell before. (18) I wish I could learn. (19) To think I am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall!"". (20) Here the poor princess looked almost sad. (21) ""I shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like,"" said the prince, devotedly. (22) ""Thank you. (23) I don't know. (24) Perhaps it would not be proper.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) So was Flo; and we kept bouncing from one side to the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. (2) Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but uncle read his guide-book, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. (3) This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up,—'Oh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!' (4) Flo, darting to my window,—'How sweet! (5) We must go there some time, won't we, papa?' (6) Uncle, calmly admiring his boots,—'No, my dear, not unless you want beer; that's a brewery.' (7) ""A pause,—then Flo cried out, 'Bless me, there's a gallows and a man going up.' (8) 'Where, where?' (9) shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts with a cross-beam and some dangling chains. (10) 'A colliery,' remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. (11) 'Here's a lovely flock oflambs all lying down,' says Amy. (12) 'See, papa, aren't they pretty!' (13) added Flo sentimentally. (14) 'Geese, young ladies,' returns uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy 'The Flirtations of Capt. (15) Cavendish,' and I have the scenery all to myself. (16) ""Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. (17) We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers. (18) Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. (19) A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. (20) Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap—nice ribbons only sixpence a yard. (21) I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in Paris. (22) Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich? (23) ""Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while aunt and uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. (24) It was so droll! (25) for when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. (2) In the confusion some struck at their own side. (3) The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly. (4) Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard. (5) Where all this time was Peter? (6) He was seeking bigger game. (7) The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain. (8) His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes. (9) But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that circle. (10) Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. (11) Hook rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. (12) The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. (13) Neither knew that the other was coming. (14) Each feeling for a grip met the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met. (15) Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to they had a sinking. (16) Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. (17) After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. (18) But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy. (19) Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe. (20) It would not have been fighting fair. (21) He gave the pirate a hand to help him up. (22) It was then that Hook bit him. (23) Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. (24) It made him quite helpless. (25) He could only stare, horrified.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door. (2) The children were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in honour of Jim's visit. (3) “That'll be the Doctor,” said Mother; “I'll go. (4) Shut the kitchen door—you're not fit to be seen.”



But it wasn't the Doctor. (5) They knew that by the voice and by the sound of the boots that went upstairs. (6) They did not recognise the sound of the boots, but everyone was certain that they had heard the voice before. (7) There was a longish interval. (8) The boots and the voice did not come down again. (9) “Who can it possibly be?” they kept on asking themselves and each other. (10) “Perhaps,” said Peter at last, “Dr. (11) Forrest has been attacked by highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the man he's telegraphed for to take his place. (12) Mrs. Viney said he had a local tenant to do his work when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney?”



“I did so, my dear,” said Mrs. Viney from the back kitchen. (13) “He's fallen down in a fit, more likely,” said Phyllis, “all human aid despaired of. (14) And this is his man come to break the news to Mother.”



“Nonsense!” said Peter, briskly; “Mother wouldn't have taken the man up into Jim's bedroom. (15) Why should she? (16) Listen—the door's opening. (17) Now they'll come down. (18) I'll open the door a crack.”

He did. (19) “It's not listening,” he replied indignantly to Bobbie's scandalised remarks; “nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs. (20) And Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr. Forrest's stable-man—and you said it was him.”



“Bobbie,” called Mother's voice. (21) They opened the kitchen door, and Mother leaned over the stair railing. (22) “Jim's grandfather has come,” she said; “wash your hands and faces and then you can see him. (23) He wants to see you!” The bedroom door shut again. (24) “There now!” said Peter; “fancy us not even thinking of that! (25) Let's have some hot water, Mrs. Viney.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) “DON'T!” said Peter, sharply. (2) They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back. (3) Before it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her eyes, and rolled herself over and begun to cry. (4) This cheered the others wonderfully. (5) They had seen her cry before, but they had never seen her faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. (6) They had not known what to do when she was fainting, but now she was only crying they could thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as they always did. (7) And presently, when she stopped crying, they were able to laugh at her for being such a coward as to faint. (8) When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an agitated meeting on the platform. (9) The praises they got for their “prompt action,” their “common sense,” their “ingenuity,” were enough to have turned anybody's head. (10) Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly. (11) She had never been a real heroine before, and the feeling was delicious. (12) Peter's ears got very red. (13) Yet he, too, enjoyed himself. (14) Only Bobbie wished they all wouldn't. (15) She wanted to get away. (16) “You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,” said the Station Master. (17) Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. (18) She pulled at Peter's jacket. (19) “Oh, come away, come away! (20) I want to go home,” she said. (21) So they went. (22) And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer. (23) “Oh, listen,” cried Phyllis; “that's for US!”

“Yes,” said Peter. (24) “I say, I am glad I thought about something red, and waving it.”



“How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!” said Phyllis.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) If it was to come to be known—even as it is, when no harm's come of it.”



“It won't come to be known,” said Peter; “we aren't sneaks. (2) All the same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty—it's dangerous.”



“Tell me something I don't know,” said the man, “but I can't help it. (3) I know'd well enough just how it 'ud be. (4) But I couldn't get off. (5) They couldn't get no one to take on my duty. (6) I tell you I ain't had ten minutes' sleep this last five days. (7) My little chap's ill—pewmonia, the Doctor says—and there's no one but me and 'is little sister to do for him. (8) That's where it is. (9) The gell must 'ave her sleep. (10) Dangerous? (11) Yes, I believe you. (12) Now go and split on me if you like.”

“Of course we won't,” said Peter, indignantly, but Phyllis ignored the whole of the signalman's speech, except the first six words. (13) “You asked us,” she said, “to tell you something you don't know. (14) Well, I will. (15) There's a boy in the tunnel over there with a red jersey and his leg broken.”



“What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for, then?” said the man. (16) “Don't you be so cross,” said Phyllis, kindly. (17) “WE haven't done anything wrong except coming and waking you up, and that was right, as it happens.”



Then Peter told how the boy came to be in the tunnel. (18) “Well,” said the man, “I don't see as I can do anything. (19) I can't leave the box.”

“You might tell us where to go after someone who isn't in a box, though,” said Phyllis. (20) “There's Brigden's farm over yonder—where you see the smoke a-coming up through the trees,” said the man, more and more grumpy, as Phyllis noticed. (21) “Well, good-bye, then,” said Peter. (22) But the man said, “Wait a minute.” He put his hand in his pocket and brought out some money—a lot of pennies and one or two shillings and sixpences and half-a-crown. (23) He picked out two shillings and held them out. (24) “Here,” he said. (25) “I'll give you this to hold your tongues about what's taken place to-day.”



There was a short, unpleasant pause.

Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) when you have lost it you won’t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. (2) That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. (3) To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. (4) It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. (5) The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.... (6) Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. (7) But what the gods give they quickly take away. (8) You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. (9) When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. (10) Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. (11) Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. (12) You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. (13) You will suffer horribly.... Ah! (14) realize your youth while you have it. (15) Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. (16) These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. (17) Live! (18) Live the wonderful life that is in you! (19) Let nothing be lost upon you. (20) Be always searching for new sensations. (21) Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants. (22) You might be its visible symbol. (23) With your personality there is nothing you could not do. (24) The world belongs to you for a season.... (25) The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.

Book Title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London. (2) I was dumbfounded. (3) What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! (4) Was it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier? (5) I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. (6) With Poirot away, I was uncertain how to act. (7) Had he foreseen this arrest? (8) Had he not, in all probability, been the cause of it? (9) Those questions I could not resolve. (10) But in the meantime what was I to do? (11) Should I announce the arrest openly at Styles, or not? (12) Though I did not acknowledge it to myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. (13) Would it not be a terrible shock to her? (14) For the moment, I set aside utterly any suspicions of her. (15) She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have heard some hint of it. (16) Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest from her. (17) It would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow. (18) Still, I shrank from blurting it out. (19) If only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. (20) What possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way? (21) In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably heightened. (22) I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not Poirot put it into my head.

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) And he hated his gold sovereigns, as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces. (2) The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey. (3) But at the second mouthful she burst out crying, and could not swallow it. (4) The king heard her sobbing. (5) Glad of anybody, but especially of his queen, to quarrel with, he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box, clapped his crown on his head, and rushed into the parlour. (6) ""What is all this about?"". (7) exclaimed he. (8) ""What are you crying for, queen?"". (9) ""I can't eat it,"" said the queen, looking ruefully at the honey-pot. (10) ""No wonder!"". (11) retorted the king. (12) ""You've just eaten your breakfast—two turkey eggs, and three anchovies."". (13) ""Oh, that's not it!"". (14) sobbed her Majesty. (15) ""It's my child, my child!"". (16) ""Well, what's the matter with your child? (17) She's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well. (18) Just hear her laughing."". (19) Yet the king could not help a sigh, which he tried to turn into a cough, saying—



""It is a good thing to be light-hearted, I am sure, whether she be ours or not."". (20) ""It is a bad thing to be light-headed,"" answered the queen, looking with prophetic soul far into the future. (21) ""'Tis a good thing to be light-handed,"" said the king. (22) ""'Tis a bad thing to be light-fingered,"" answered the queen. (23) ""'Tis a good thing to be light-footed,"" said the king. (24) ""'Tis a bad thing—"" began the queen; but the king interrupted her. (25) ""In fact,"" said he, with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents, and in which, therefore, he has come off triumphant—""in fact, it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied. (26) "".

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”



He jumped up and sat on the sofa. (2) The beating of his heart was a positive pain. (3) “Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. (4) “He’s taken to bolting himself in! (5) As if he were worth stealing! (6) Open, you stupid, wake up!”

“What do they want? (7) Why the porter? (8) All’s discovered. (9) Resist or open? (10) Come what may!...”

He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door. (11) His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed. (12) Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there. (13) Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. (14) He glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax. (15) “A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper. (16) “From what office?”

“A summons to the police office, of course. (17) You know which office.”

“To the police?... (18) What for?...”

“How can I tell? (19) You’re sent for, so you go.”

The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to go away. (20) “He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him. (21) The porter turned his head for a moment. (22) “He’s been in a fever since yesterday,” she added. (23) Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without opening it. (24) “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately, seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. (25) “You’re ill, and so don’t go; there’s no such hurry.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) May I try this way?"". (2) ""Yes; but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. (3) Wear your ring, dear, and do your best; I think you will prosper, for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. (4) Now I must go back to Beth. (5) Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again."". (6) That evening, while Meg was writing to her father, to report the traveller's safe arrival, Jo slipped up stairs into Beth's room, and, finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look. (7) ""What is it, deary?"". (8) asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face which invited confidence. (9) ""I want to tell you something, mother."". (10) ""About Meg?"". (11) ""How quickly you guessed! (12) Yes, it's about her, and though it's a little thing, it fidgets me."". (13) ""Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. (14) That Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?"". (15) asked Mrs. March rather sharply. (16) ""No, I should have shut the door in his face if he had,"" said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. (17) ""Last summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences', and only one was returned. (18) We forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it. (19) He kept it in his waistcoat pocket, and once it fell out, and Teddy joked him about it, and Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg, but didn't dare say so, she was so young and he so poor. (20) Now, isn't it adreadful state of things?"". (21) ""Do you think Meg cares for him?"". (22) asked Mrs. March, with an anxious look. (23) ""Mercy me! (24) I don't know anything about love and such nonsense! (25) "".

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) They've searched your things, but you ... what does it matter to you? (2) You will be none the worse for it."". (3) Mashenka was silent and went on packing. (4) Nikolay Sergeitch pinched his moustache, as though wondering what he should say next, and went on in an ingratiating voice:



""I understand, of course, but you must make allowances. (5) You know my wife is nervous, headstrong; you mustn't judge her too harshly."". (6) Mashenka did not speak. (7) ""If you are so offended,"" Nikolay Sergeitch went on, ""well, if you like, I'm ready to apologise. (8) I ask your pardon."". (9) Mashenka made no answer, but only bent lower over her box. (10) This exhausted, irresolute man was of absolutely no significance in the household. (11) He stood in the pitiful position of a dependent and hanger-on, even with the servants, and his apology meant nothing either. (12) ""H'm!... (13) You say nothing! (14) That's not enough for you. (15) In that case, I will apologise for my wife. (16) In my wife's name.... She behaved tactlessly, I admit it as a gentleman...."".

 (17) Nikolay Sergeitch walked about the room, heaved a sigh, and went on:



""Then you want me to have it rankling here, under my heart.... You want my conscience to torment me...."".

 (18) ""I know it's not your fault, Nikolay Sergeitch,"" said Mashenka, looking him full in the face with her big tear-stained eyes. (19) ""Why should you worry yourself?"". (20) ""Of course, no.... (21) But still, don't you ... go away. (22) I entreat you."". (23) Mashenka shook her head. (24) Nikolay Sergeitch stopped at the window and drummed on the pane with his finger-tips. (25) ""Such misunderstandings are simply torture to me,"" he said. (26) ""Why, do you want me to go down on my knees to you, or what?

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. (2) “They must be swimming back or flying,” the boys concluded. (3) They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. (4) They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault! (5) When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry. (6) “Help, help!”

Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay on the boy’s arm. (7) With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her. (8) Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising. (9) He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more. (10) As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling her softly into the water. (11) Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. (12) But he had to tell her the truth. (13) “We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. (14) Soon the water will be over it.”

She did not understand even now. (15) “We must go,” she said, almost brightly. (16) “Yes,” he answered faintly. (17) “Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”

He had to tell her. (18) “Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without my help?”



She had to admit that she was too tired. (19) He moaned. (20) “What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once. (21) “I can’t help you, Wendy. (22) Hook wounded me. (23) I can neither fly nor swim.”

“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”



“Look how the water is rising.”



They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. (24) They thought they would soon be no more.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) “Slightly is coughing on the table.”



“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”



“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”



“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”



“I complain of the twins.”



“I complain of Curly.”



“I complain of Nibs.”



“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied.”



She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual. (2) “Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”



“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you are the littlest. (3) A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house.”



While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. (4) It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time. (5) There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it. (6) “Children, I hear your father’s step. (7) He likes you to meet him at the door.”

Above, the redskins crouched before Peter. (8) “Watch well, braves. (9) I have spoken.”

And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. (10) As so often before, but never again. (11) He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy. (12) “Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered. (13) “Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun. (14) “It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to Curly. (15) “I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly. (16) The first twin came to Peter. (17) “Father, we want to dance.”

“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour. (18) “But we want you to dance.”

Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be scandalised. (19) “Me! (20) My old bones would rattle!”

“And mummy too.”



“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”



“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated. (21) It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did it. (22) “Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting. (23) “People of our figure, Wendy!”

“But it is only among our own progeny.”



“True, true.”



So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first. (24) “Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”



“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified. (25) “Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”

“Michael takes after you.”



She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) She even searched Mihailo, the porter, herself. (2) It's a perfect disgrace! (3) Nikolay Sergeitch simply looks on and cackles like a hen. (4) But you've no need to tremble like that, miss. (5) They found nothing here. (6) You've nothing to be afraid of if you didn't take the brooch."". (7) ""But, Liza, it's vile ... it's insulting,"" said Mashenka, breathless with indignation. (8) ""It's so mean, so low! (9) What right had she to suspect me and to rummage in my things?"". (10) ""You are living with strangers, miss,"" sighed Liza. (11) ""Though you are a young lady, still you are ... as it were ... a servant.... (12) It's not like living with your papa and mamma."". (13) Mashenka threw herself on the bed and sobbed bitterly. (14) Never in her life had she been subjected to such an outrage, never had she been so deeply insulted.... She, well-educated, refined, the daughter of a teacher, was suspected of theft; she had been searched like a street-walker! (15) She could not imagine a greater insult. (16) And to this feeling of resentment was added an oppressive dread of what would come next. (17) All sorts of absurd ideas came into her mind. (18) If they could suspect her of theft, then they might arrest her, strip her naked, and search her, then lead her through the street with an escort of soldiers, cast her into a cold, dark cell with mice and woodlice, exactly like the dungeon in which Princess Tarakanov was imprisoned. (19) Who would stand up for her? (20) Her parents lived far away in the provinces; they had not the money to come to her.

Book Title: The Railway Children

Book Author: E. Nesbit

Paragraph: (1) Then you see slimy, oozy trickles of water running down the inside of the tunnel, and you notice that the bricks are not red or brown, as they are at the tunnel's mouth, but dull, sticky, sickly green. (2) Your voice, when you speak, is quite changed from what it was out in the sunshine, and it is a long time before the tunnel is quite dark. (3) It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when Phyllis caught at Bobbie's skirt, ripping out half a yard of gathers, but no one noticed this at the time. (4) “I want to go back,” she said, “I don't like it. (5) It'll be pitch dark in a minute. (6) I WON'T go on in the dark. (7) I don't care what you say, I WON'T.”

“Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter; “I've got a candle end and matches, and—what's that?”



“That” was a low, humming sound on the railway line, a trembling of the wires beside it, a buzzing, humming sound that grew louder and louder as they listened. (8) “It's a train,” said Bobbie. (9) “Which line?”

“Let me go back,” cried Phyllis, struggling to get away from the hand by which Bobbie held her. (10) “Don't be a coward,” said Bobbie; “it's quite safe. (11) Stand back.”

“Come on,” shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead. (12) “Quick! (13) Manhole!”

The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise you hear when your head is under water in the bath and both taps are running, and you are kicking with your heels against the bath's tin sides. (14) But Peter had shouted for all he was worth, and Bobbie heard him. (15) She dragged Phyllis along to the manhole. (16) Phyllis, of course, stumbled over the wires and grazed both her legs. (17) But they dragged her in, and all three stood in the dark, damp, arched recess while the train roared louder and louder. (18) It seemed as if it would deafen them. (19) And, in the distance, they could see its eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant. (20) “It IS a dragon—I always knew it was—it takes its own shape in here, in the dark,” shouted Phyllis. (21) But nobody heard her. (22) You see the train was shouting, too, and its voice was bigger than hers. (23) And now, with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling flash of lighted carriage windows, a smell of smoke, and blast of hot air, the train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in the vaulted roof of the tunnel. (24) Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other.

Book Title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) I lowered my voice to a whisper. (2) “I believe she has been poisoned! (3) I’m certain Dr. Bauerstein suspects it.”

“What?” She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating wildly. (4) Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “No, no—not that—not that!” And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. (5) I followed her, afraid that she was going to faint. (6) I found her leaning against the bannisters, deadly pale. (7) She waved me away impatiently. (8) “No, no—leave me. (9) I’d rather be alone. (10) Let me just be quiet for a minute or two. (11) Go down to the others.”

I obeyed her reluctantly. (12) John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. (13) I joined them. (14) We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of us all when I at last broke it by saying:



“Where is Mr. Inglethorp?”



John shook his head. (15) “He’s not in the house.”

Our eyes met. (16) WherewasAlfred Inglethorp? (17) His absence was strange and inexplicable. (18) I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words. (19) What lay beneath them? (20) What more could she have told us, if she had had time? (21) At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. (22) Dr. Wilkins was looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm. (23) Dr. Bauerstein remained in the background, his grave bearded face unchanged. (24) Dr. Wilkins was the spokesman for the two.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) ""Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady."". (2) Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. (3) Both peeped and criticised and chatted, till they felt like old acquaintances. (4) Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. (5) She liked the ""Laurence boy"" better than ever, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them. (6) ""Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine teeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. (7) Wonder how old he is?"". (8) It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask; but she checked herself in time, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way. (9) ""I suppose you are going to college soon? (10) I see you pegging away at your books,—no, I mean studying hard""; and Jo blushed at the dreadful ""pegging"" which had escaped her. (11) Laurie smiled, but didn't seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,—



""Not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway."". (12) ""Aren't you but fifteen?"". (13) asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already. (14) ""Sixteen, next month."". (15) ""How I wish I was going to college! (16) You don't look as if you liked it."". (17) ""I hate it! (18) Nothing but grinding or skylarking. (19) And I don't like the way fellows do either, in this country."". (20) ""What do you like?"". (21) ""To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."". (22) Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, ""That's a splendid polka! (23) Why don't you go and try it?"". (24) ""If you will come too,"" he answered, with a gallant little bow.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) ""Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?"". (2) asked Meg, with a shiver. (3) ""I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. (4) I never snivel over trifles like that; I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table, and felt only the short, rough ends on my head. (5) It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or a leg off. (6) The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. (7) I'll give it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by; for a crop is so comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again."". (8) Mrs. March folded the wavy, chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. (9) She only said ""Thank you, deary,"" but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day to-morrow, and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed. (10) No one wanted to go to bed, when, at ten o'clock, Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said, ""Come, girls."". (11) Beth went to the piano and played the father's favorite hymn; all began bravely, but broke down one by one, till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler. (12) ""Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early, and shall need all the sleep we can get. (13) Good-night, my darlings,"" said Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another. (14) They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. (15) Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. (16) Jo lay motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek,—



""Jo, dear, what is it? (17) Are you crying about father?"". (18) ""No, not now."". (19) ""What then?"". (20) ""My—my hair!"". (21) burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow. (22) It did not sound at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner. (23) ""I'm not sorry,"" protested Jo, with a choke. (24) ""I'd do it again to-morrow, if I could. (25) It's only the vain, selfish part of me that goes and cries in this silly way.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) But why are you all silent again? (2) I do all the talking.”

“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia. (3) “And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna. (4) “A-ah! (5) What a big one! (6) Hardly like a lady’s.”

“I like that sort,” said Dounia. (7) “So it is not a present from herfiancé,” thought Razumihin, and was unreasonably delighted. (8) “I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov. (9) “No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”

“A-ah! (10) And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it. (11) “Oh, yes, my dear.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin. (12) “H’m, yes. (13) What shall I tell you? (14) I don’t remember much indeed. (15) She was such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again. (16) “Quite an invalid. (17) She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it. (18) Yes, yes, I remember. (19) I remember very well. (20) She was an ugly little thing. (21) I really don’t know what drew me to her then—I think it was because she was always ill. (22) If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he smiled dreamily. (23) “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”

“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling. (24) He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did not understand her words.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees. (2) “You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. (3) Peter will be so pleased with me.”

Overhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. (4) The others did not hear her. (5) They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. (6) If Wendy’s heart had been beating they would all have heard it. (7) Slightly was the first to speak. (8) “This is no bird,” he said in a scared voice. (9) “I think this must be a lady.”

“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling. (10) “And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely. (11) They all whipped off their caps. (12) “Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground. (13) “A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you have killed her!”



They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him. (14) Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before. (15) “I did it,” he said, reflecting. (16) “When ladies used to come to me in dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she really came, I shot her.”



He moved slowly away. (17) “Don’t go,” they called in pity. (18) “I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”



It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. (19) They heard Peter crow.

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) One day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest. (2) These forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers, like a sieve that keeps back the bran. (3) Then the princes get away to follow their fortunes. (4) In this way they have the advantage of the princesses, who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun. (5) I wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes. (6) One lovely evening, after wandering about for many days, he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest; for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them; and he soon came upon a kind of heath. (7) Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood; but by this time it was getting late, and there was nobody in the fields to direct him. (8) After travelling for another hour, his horse, quite worn out with long labour and lack of food, fell, and was unable to rise again. (9) So he continued his journey on foot. (10) At length he entered another wood—not a wild forest, but a civilized wood, through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake. (11) Along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness. (12) Suddenly he paused, and listened. (13) Strange sounds came across the water. (14) It was, in fact, the princess laughing. (15) Now there was something odd in her laugh, as I have already hinted; for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity; and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming. (16) Looking over the lake, he saw something white in the water; and, in an instant, he had torn off his tunic, kicked off his sandals, and plunged in. (17) He soon reached the white object, and found that it was a woman. (18) There was not light enough to show that she was a princess, but quite enough to show that she was a lady, for it does not want much light to see that. (19) Now I cannot tell how it came about,—whether she pretended to be drowning, or whether he frightened her, or caught her so as to embarrass her,—but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer, and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be; for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak. (20) At the place to which he bore her, the bank was only a foot or two above the water; so he gave her a strong lift out of the water, to lay her on the bank. (21) But, her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water, away she went up into the air, scolding and screaming. (22) ""You naughty, naughty, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY man!"". (23) she cried. (24) No one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before. (25) When the prince saw her ascend, he thought he must have been bewitched, and have mistaken a great swan for a lady. (26) But the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir.

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) But it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him; it was the double use of the word light. (2) For the king hated all witticisms, and punning especially. (3) And besides, he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired; for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself? (4) He turned upon his other heel, and rejoined her. (5) She looked angry still, because she knew that she was guilty, or, what was much the same, knew that HE thought so. (6) ""My dear queen,"" said he, ""duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank, not to say kings and queens; and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning."". (7) ""There!"". (8) said the queen, ""I never made a jest, but I broke it in the making. (9) I am the most unfortunate woman in the world!"". (10) She looked so rueful, that the king took her in his arms; and they sat down to consult. (11) ""Can you bear this?"". (12) said the king. (13) ""No, I can't,"" said the queen. (14) ""Well, what's to be done?"". (15) said the king. (16) ""I'm sure I don't know,"" said the queen. (17) ""But might you not try an apology?"". (18) ""To my old sister, I suppose you mean?"". (19) said the king. (20) ""Yes,"" said the queen. (21) ""Well, I don't mind,"" said the king. (22) So he went the next morning to the house of the princess, and, making a very humble apology, begged her to undo the spell. (23) But the princess declared, with a grave face, that she knew nothing at all about it. (24) Her eyes, however, shone pink, which was a sign that she was happy.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s past two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had pulled him from the sofa. (2) “What! (3) Past two o’clock!”

He sat down on the sofa—and instantly recollected everything! (4) All at once, in one flash, he recollected everything. (5) For the first moment he thought he was going mad. (6) A dreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep. (7) Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. (8) He opened the door and began listening—everything in the house was asleep. (9) With amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his hat off. (10) It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow. (11) “If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? (12) That I’m drunk but...”

He rushed to the window. (13) There was light enough, and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there no traces? (14) But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking off everything and looking over again. (15) He turned everything over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through his search three times. (16) But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers. (17) He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads. (18) There seemed to be nothing more. (19) Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his pockets! (20) He had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them! (21) He had not even thought of them while he was examining his clothes! (22) What next? (23) Instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table. (24) When he had pulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. (25) The paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters.

Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) The picture had to be concealed. (2) There was no help for it. (3) “Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. (4) “I am sorry I kept you so long. (5) I was thinking of something else.”

“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath. (6) “Where shall we put it, sir?”

“Oh, anywhere. (7) Here: this will do. (8) I don’t want to have it hung up. (9) Just lean it against the wall. (10) Thanks.”

“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”



Dorian started. (11) “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said, keeping his eye on the man. (12) He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life. (13) “I shan’t trouble you any more now. (14) I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”



“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. (15) Ever ready to do anything for you, sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face. (16) He had never seen any one so marvellous. (17) When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket. (18) He felt safe now. (19) No one would ever look upon the horrible thing. (20) No eye but his would ever see his shame. (21) On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock and that the tea had been already brought up. (22) On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. (23) A copy of the third edition ofThe St. James’s Gazettehad been placed on the tea-tray. (24) It was evident that Victor had returned. (25) He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.

Book Title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles

Book Author: Agatha Christie

Paragraph: (1) In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his activity. (2) Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. (3) He also took long walks into the country. (4) I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at. (5) It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes’s farm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet him. (6) But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to the farm itself. (7) As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at me cunningly. (8) “You’m from the Hall, bain’t you?” he asked. (9) “Yes. (10) I’m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way.”



“A little chap? (11) As waves his hands when he talks? (12) One of them Belgies from the village?”

“Yes,” I said eagerly. (13) “He has been here, then?”

“Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. (14) More’n once too. (15) Friend of yours, is he? (16) Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall—you’m a pretty lot!” And he leered more jocosely than ever. (17) “Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?” I asked, as carelessly as I could. (18) He winked at me knowingly. (19) “Onedoes, mister. (20) Naming no names, mind.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) “Perhaps Tinker Bell will tell me.”



“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. (2) “She is an abandoned little creature.”

Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent. (3) “She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted. (4) He had a sudden idea. (5) “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”

“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion. (6) She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation. (7) “I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. (8) Fancy Wendy snapping! (9) But she had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out. (10) If she had known she would not have snapped. (11) None of them knew. (12) Perhaps it was best not to know. (13) Their ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. (14) They sang and danced in their night-gowns. (15) Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. (16) So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! (17) It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again. (18) The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s good-night story! (19) Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself, and he said gloomily:



“Yes, it is a dull beginning. (20) I say, let us pretend that it is the end.”

And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. (21) Usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. (22) But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) Even Nastasya had not touched it. (2) But heavens! (3) how could he have left all those things in the hole? (4) He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. (5) There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases. (6) There was a chain, too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked like a decoration.... (7) He put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible. (8) He took the purse, too. (9) Then he went out of his room, leaving the door open. (10) He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. (11) He was afraid of pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces before then. (12) He must clear everything up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him.... Where was he to go? (13) That had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. (14) But to get rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. (15) He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere. (16) Moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. (17) And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking? (18) And of course they would. (19) Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to do but to watch him. (20) “Why is it, or can it be my fancy?” he thought. (21) At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva. (22) There were not so many people there, he would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off. (23) He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before. (24) And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium!

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. (2) So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them. (3) Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. (4) She stood over them to let them have their sleep out. (5) Was it not brave of Wendy? (6) It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep. (7) Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others. (8) He stood motionless, one hand to his ear. (9) “Pirates!” he cried. (10) The others came closer to him. (11) A strange smile was playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. (12) While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey. (13) The order came sharp and incisive. (14) “Dive!”

There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. (15) Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned. (16) The boat drew nearer. (17) It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. (18) Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. (19) She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground? (20) Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough. (21) They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. (22) No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. (23) Now her fate would help to guard it also. (24) One more wail would go the round in that wind by night. (25) In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it.

Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) In a few moments, his hand was on his arm. (2) “Dorian! (3) What an extraordinary piece of luck! (4) I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o’clock. (5) Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. (6) I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left. (7) I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. (8) But I wasn’t quite sure. (9) Didn’t you recognize me?”

“In this fog, my dear Basil? (10) Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor Square. (11) I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at all certain about it. (12) I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages. (13) But I suppose you will be back soon?”

“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. (14) I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head. (15) However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk. (16) Here we are at your door. (17) Let me come in for a moment. (18) I have something to say to you.”

“I shall be charmed. (19) But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch-key. (20) The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch. (21) “I have heaps of time,” he answered. (22) “The train doesn’t go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. (23) In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you. (24) You see, I shan’t have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. (25) All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”



Dorian looked at him and smiled.

Book Title: The Light Princess

Book Author: George MacDonald

Paragraph: (1) He disguised himself, and, going to the palace, requested to see the lord chamberlain. (2) His appearance at once gained his request; and the lord chamberlain, being a man of some insight, perceived that there was more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear. (3) He felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise. (4) So he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoeblack to the princess. (5) It was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post, for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses. (6) He soon learned all that could be told about the princess. (7) He went nearly distracted; but after roaming about the lake for days, and diving in every depth that remained, all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for. (8) For the princess kept her room, with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake, But she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment. (9) It haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul, drying up within her, first to mud, then to madness and death. (10) She thus brooded over the change, with all its dreadful accompaniments, till she was nearly distracted. (11) As for the prince, she had forgotten him. (12) However much she had enjoyed his company in the water, she did not care for him without it. (13) But she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too. (14) The lake went on sinking. (15) Small slimy spots began to appear, which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water. (16) These grew to broad patches of mud, which widened and spread, with rocks here and there, and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming. (17) The people went everywhere catching these, and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats. (18) At length the lake was all but gone, only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted. (19) It happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake. (20) It was a rocky basin of considerable depth. (21) Looking in, they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun. (22) A little boy jumped in and dived for it. (23) It was a plate of gold covered with writing. (24) They carried it to the king.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) ""You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. (2) How many did you have out?"". (3) Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to laugh, as if mightily amused at something. (4) ""There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week."". (5) ""What are you laughing at? (6) You are up to some mischief, Jo,"" said Laurie, looking mystified. (7) ""So are you. (8) What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?"". (9) ""Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."". (10) ""I'm glad of that."". (11) ""Why?"". (12) ""You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."". (13) Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves. (14) ""I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will straighten you up capitally. (15) But I don't believe that was your only reason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?"". (16) ""No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you never go to such places. (17) Do you?"". (18) ""Not often."". (19) ""I wish you wouldn't."". (20) ""It's no harm, Jo. (21) I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless you have good players; so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."". (22) ""Oh dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. (23) I did hope you'd stay respectable, and be a satisfaction to your friends,"" said Jo, shaking her head. (24) ""Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability?"". (25) asked Laurie, looking nettled.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. (2) A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... (3) I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. (4) I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! (5) Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... (6) The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. (7) That’s how it happened!”

“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed. (8) “He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared. (9) “Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third. (10) But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. (11) It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. (12) All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. (13) No one knew his name. (14) Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. (15) The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. (16) He recognised him. (17) “I know him! (18) I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. (19) “It’s a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. (20) He lives close by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! (21) I will pay, see?” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. (22) He was in violent agitation. (23) The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. (24) Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once. (25) “Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German.

Book Title: The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories

Book Author: Anton Pavlovich Chekhov

Paragraph: (1) He could write a complete manual of horticulture."". (2) Yegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh, blushed, and began uttering the phrases usually made use of by an embarrassed author. (3) At last he began to give way. (4) ""In that case, begin with Gaucher's article and these Russian articles,"" he muttered, turning over the pamphlets with a trembling hand, ""or else you won't understand. (5) Before you read my objections, you must know what I am objecting to. (6) But it's all nonsense ... tiresome stuff. (7) Besides, I believe it's bedtime."". (8) Tanya went away. (9) Yegor Semyonitch sat down on the sofa by Kovrin and heaved a deep sigh. (10) ""Yes, my boy ..."". (11) he began after a pause. (12) ""That's how it is, my dear lecturer. (13) Here I write articles, and take part in exhibitions, and receive medals.... Pesotsky, they say, has apples the size of a head, and Pesotsky, they say, has made his fortune with his garden. (14) In short, 'Kotcheby is rich and glorious.' (15) But one asks oneself: what is it all for? (16) The garden is certainly fine, a model. (17) It's not really a garden, but a regular institution, which is of the greatest public importance because it marks, so to say, a new era in Russian agriculture and Russian industry. (18) But, what's it for? (19) What's the object of it?"". (20) ""The fact speaks for itself."". (21) ""I do not mean in that sense. (22) I meant to ask: what will happen to the garden when I die? (23) In the condition in which you see it now, it would not be maintained for one month without me. (24) The whole secret of success lies not in its being a big garden or a great number of labourers being employed in it, but in the fact that I love the work. (25) Do you understand?

Book Title: The Picture of Dorian Gray

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) “Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. (2) “You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner.”

“I am quite well, Harry. (3) I am tired. (4) That is all.”

“You were charming last night. (5) The little duchess is quite devoted to you. (6) She tells me she is going down to Selby.”

“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”



“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”



“Oh, yes, Harry.”



“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. (7) She is very clever, too clever for a woman. (8) She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness. (9) It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious. (10) Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay. (11) White porcelain feet, if you like. (12) They have been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. (13) She has had experiences.”

“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian. (14) “An eternity, she tells me. (15) I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in. (16) Who else is coming?”

“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set. (17) I have asked Lord Grotrian.”

“I like him,” said Lord Henry. (18) “A great many people don’t, but I find him charming. (19) He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. (20) He is a very modern type.”

“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. (21) He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.”



“Ah! (22) what a nuisance people’s people are! (23) Try and make him come. (24) By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night.
