(2) Hammered out on that shield and colored with red and brown colors was the image of a Dragon, a Dragon lengthening himself out of a cave. (3) Sigurd thought it was the image of the most hateful thing in the world, and the light of the smithy fire falling on it, and the smoke of the smithy fire rising round it, made it seem verily a Dragon living in his own element of fire and reek. (4) While he was still gazing on the loathly image, Regin, the cunning smith, came into the smithy. (5) He stood by the wall and he watched Sigurd. (6) His back was bent; his hair fell over his eyes that were all fiery, and he looked like a beast that runs behind the hedges. (7) \"Aye, thou dost look on Fafnir the Dragon, son of the Volsungs,\" he said to Sigurd. (8) \"Mayhap it is thou who wilt slay him.\". (9) \"I would not strive with such a beast. (10) He is all horrible to me,\" Sigurd said. (11) \"With a good sword thou mightst slay him and win for thyself more renown than ever thy fathers had,\" Regin whispered. (12) \"I shall win renown as my fathers won renown, in battle with men and in conquest of kingdoms,\" Sigurd said. (13) \"Thou art not a true Volsung or thou wouldst gladly go where most danger and dread is,\" said Regin. (14) \"Thou hast heard of Fafnir the Dragon, whose image I have wrought here. (15) If thou dost ride to the crest of the hills thou mayst look across to the desolate land where Fafnir has his haunt. (16) Know that once it was fair land where men had peace and prosperity, but Fafnir came and made his den in a cave near by, and his breathings as he went to and came from the River withered up the land and made it the barren waste that men called Gnita Heath. (17) Now, if thou art a true Volsung, thou wilt slay the Dragon, and let that land become fair again, and bring the people back to it and so add to King Alv's domain.\". (18) \"I have nought to do with the slaying of Dragons,\" Sigurd said. (19) \"I have to make war on King Lygni, and avenge upon him the slaying of Sigmund, my father.\". (20) \"What is the slaying of Lygni and the conquest of his kingdom to the slaying of Fafnir the Dragon?\". (21) Regin cried. (22) \"I will tell thee what no one else knows of Fafnir the Dragon. (23) He guards a hoard of gold and jewels the like of which was never seen in the world. (24) All this hoard you can make yours by slaying him.\". (25) \"I do not covet riches,\" Sigurd said. (26) \"No riches is like to the riches that Fafnir guards. (27) His hoard is the hoard that the Dwarf Andvari had from the world's early days. (28) Once the Gods themselves paid it overas a ransom. (29) And if thou wilt win this hoard thou wilt be as one of the Gods.\". (30) \"How dost thou know that of which thou speakst, Regin?

(2) There among the flowers were hundreds of tiny beings, some playing on tiny reed instruments and flower horns, while others sang. (3) This was the strange, wonderful music Raggedy and Fido had heard. (4) \"It's the Fairies!\". (5) said Raggedy Ann. (6) \"To your basket quick, Fido! (7) They are coming this way!\". (8) And Raggedy Ann ran back to her bed, with the bed clothes trailing behind her. (9) Fido gave three jumps and he was in his basket, pretending he was sound asleep, but one little black eye was peeping through a chink in the side. (10) Raggedy jumped into her bed and pulled the covers to her chin, but lay so that her shoe-button eyes could see towards the window. (11) Little Fairy forms radiant as silver came flitting into the nursery, singing in far away voices. (12) They carried a little bundle. (13) A beautiful light came from this bundle, and to Raggedy Ann and Fido it seemed like sunshine and moonshine mixed. (14) It was a soft mellow light, just the sort of light you would expect to accompany Fairy Folk. (15) As Raggedy watched, her candy heart went pitty-pat against her cotton stuffing, for she saw a tiny pink foot sticking out of the bundle of light. (16) The Fairy troop sailed across the nursery and through the door with their bundle and Raggedy Ann and Fido listened to their far away music as they went down the hall. (17) Presently the Fairies returned without the bundle and disappeared through the nursery window. (18) Raggedy Ann and Fido again ran to the window and saw the Fairy troop dancing among the flowers. (19) The light from the bundle still hung about the nursery and a strange lovely perfume floated about. (20) When the Fairies' music ceased and they had flown away, Raggedy Ann and Fido returned to Raggedy's bed to think it all out. (21) When old Mister Sun peeped over the garden wall and into the nursery, and the other dolls awakened, Raggedy Ann and Fido were still puzzled. (22) \"What is it, Raggedy Ann?\". (23) asked the tin soldier and Uncle Clem, in one voice. (24) Before Raggedy Ann could answer, Marcella came running into the nursery, gathered up all the dolls in her arms, and ran down the hall, Fido jumping beside her and barking shrilly. (25) \"Be quiet!\". (26) Marcella said to Fido, \"It's asleep and you might awaken it!\". (27) Mamma helped Marcella arrange all the dolls in a circle around the bed so that they could all see what was in the bundle. (28) Mamma gently pulled back the soft covering and the dolls saw a tiny little fist as pink as coral, a soft little face with a cunning tiny pink nose, and a little head as bald as the French dolly's when her hair came off. (29) My, how the dollies all chattered when they were once again left alone in the nursery!\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who helped Marcella

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077ih3pwy0738effin7bb", "global_key": "57c88_7_42", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Emma\n\nBook Author: Jane Austen\n\nParagraph: (1) The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama. (2) I hope we shall have her here next week. (3) Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what room there will be for the children?”\n\n\n\n“Oh! (4) yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you know. (5) Why should there be any change?”\n\n“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here! (6) not since last Easter, and then only for a few days. (7) Mr. (8) John Knightley’s being a lawyer is very inconvenient. (9) Poor Isabella! (10) she is sadly taken away from us all! (11) and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!”\n\n\n\n“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”\n\n\n\n“I do not know, my dear. (12) I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married.”\n\n\n\n“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, my dear, if there is time. (13) But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is coming for only one week. (14) There will not be time for any thing.”\n\n“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of necessity. (15) Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. (16) Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.”\n\n\n\n“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield.”\n\n\n\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley’s claims on his brother, or any body’s claims on Isabella, except his own. (17) He sat musing a little while, and then said,\n\n“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he does. (18) I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us. (19) She and the children might stay very well.”\n\n“Ah! (20) papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. (21) Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband.”\n\n\n\nThis was too true for contradiction. (22) Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter’s attachment to her husband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them. (23) “Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here. (24) I am sure she will be pleased with the children. (25) We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? (26) I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?”\n\n\n\n“Aye, I wonder which she will. (27) Poor little dears, how glad they will be to come. (28) They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”\n\n\n\n“I dare say they are, sir. (29) I am sure I do not know who is not.”\n\n“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. (30) Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. (31) John, the second, is named after his father. (32) Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. (33) And he is a very clever boy, indeed. (34) They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. (35) They will come and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?’ and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. (36) I think their father is too rough with them very often.”\n\n\n\n“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not think him rough.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Henry ask his grandpapa for?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077in3pwz0738z0pzqzfe", "global_key": "7acb5_7_44", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Emma\n\nBook Author: Jane Austen\n\nParagraph: (1) I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. (2) I was desired to say so from both. (3) It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there. (4) They can do nothing satisfactorily without you.”\n\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown. (5) There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect. (6) “Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. (7) Look! (8) in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\n\n\n\n“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. (9) “What does all that signify? (10) You will see nothing of it by candlelight. (11) It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. (12) We never see any thing of it on our club-nights.”\n\n\n\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know when things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.”\n\n\n\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. (13) It regarded a supper-room. (14) At the time of the ballroom’s being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition. (15) What was to be done? (16) This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper? (17) Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. (18) This made a difficulty. (19) Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper. (20) Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion. (21) A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. (22) She then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n\n\n\n“I do not think itisso very small. (23) We shall not be many, you know.”\n\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,\n\n\n\n“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. (24) It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\n\n\n\n“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. (25) To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. (26) You want your neighbours’ opinions. (27) I do not wonder at you. (28) If one could ascertain what the chief of them—the Coles, for instance. (29) They are not far off.

(2) No! (3) no! (4) I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are quits.”\n\n\n\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\n\n\n\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? (5) What is done is done. (6) Let us talk of your happy return, my boy. (7) I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. (8) ‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he. (9) “‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\n\n\n\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\n\n\n\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. (10) And so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”\n\n\n\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, to be sure I am. (11) I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. (12) But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table. (13) The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor. (14) “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. (15) I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. (16) Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\n\n\n\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. (17) “I am not in any want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. (18) Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”\n\n\n\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès. (19) “No doubt, my boy; no doubt. (20) Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\n\n\n\n“M. (21) Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès. (22) “Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\n\n\n\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”\n\n\n\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son. (23) “And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man. (24) “That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man. (25) “I was most anxious to see you.”\n\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse. (26) “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.”\n\n\n\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”\n\n\n\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès. (27) “So much the better—so much the better! (28) Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\n\n\n\n“Mercédès?” said the old man. (29) “Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\n\n\n\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”\n\n\n\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\n\n\n\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied Edmond. (30) “Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.”\n\n\n\n“And why?”\n\n\n\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\n\n\n\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness. (31) “Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\n\n\n\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\n\n\n\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who did the old man refer to when he mentioned someone behind the Saint Nicolas citadel?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"27\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"28\": \"Sentence 28\",\n                \"29\": \"Sentence 29\",\n                \"30\": \"Sentence 30\",\n                \"31\": \"Sentence 31\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"28\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 28 is the correct answer to the question because it refers to a conversation where someone behind the Saint Nicolas citadel is mentioned, and the name \\\"Merc\\u00e9d\\u00e8s\\\" is directly identified in response to this mention.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"What did Dant\\u00e8s say about repaying someone who has helped you?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"4\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 4 is the correct answer to the question because it contains Dant\\u00e8s\\\" statement about owing gratitude to those who have assisted us, which directly addresses the concept of repaying someone who has helped you.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"Who felt anxious to see someone?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"22\": \"Sentence 22\",\n                \"23\": \"Sentence 23\",\n                \"24\": \"Sentence 24\",\n                \"25\": \"Sentence 25\",\n                \"26\": \"Sentence 26\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"25\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 25 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly mentions that the speaker was \\\"most anxious to see you,\\\" indicating his eagerness to meet the person he is speaking to.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"Where did the speaker go to match a piece of mulberry cloth?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\",\n                \"6\": \"Sentence 6\",\n                \"7\": \"Sentence 7\",\n                \"8\": \"Sentence 8\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"7\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 7 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that the speaker had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"Who appreciates M.

(4) Gerald said: \"This is perfectly beastly,\" and Kathleen broke into wild weeping. (5) \"Don't cry, little girl!\". (6) said That-which-had-been-Jimmy; \"and you, boy, can't you give a civil answer to a civil question?\". (7) \"He doesn't know us!\". (8) wailed Kathleen. (9) \"Who doesn't know you?\". (10) said That-which-had-been impatiently. (11) \"Y—y—youdon't!\". (12) Kathleen sobbed. (13) \"I certainly don't,\" returned That-which—— \"but surely that need not distress you so deeply.\".

(17) Because if you are it's simply abject rot——\"\n\n\"My name is Mr. (18) —,\" said That-which-had-been-Jimmy, and gave the name correctly. (19) By the way, it will perhaps be shorter to call this elderly stout person who was Jimmy grown rich by some simpler name than I have just used. (20) Let us call him \"That\"—short for \"That-which-had-been-Jimmy.\". (21) \"Whatarewe to do?\". (22) whispered Mabel, awestruck; and aloud she said: \"Oh, Mr. James, or whatever you call yourself,dogive me the ring.\". (23) For on That's finger the fatal ring showed plain. (24) \"Certainly not,\" said That firmly. (25) \"You appear to be a very grasping child.\". (26) \"But what are you going todo?\". (27) Gerald asked in the flat tones of complete hopelessness. (28) \"Your interest is very flattering,\" said That. (29) \"Will you tell me, or won't you, the way to the nearest railway-station?\". (30) \"No,\" said Gerald, \"we won't.

Nesbit\n\nParagraph: (1) \"Ah!\". (2) said Phœbus, and laughed. (3) \"Wouldn't you like to know!\". (4) Then the great marble King of the Gods yawned, stroked his long beard, and said: \"Enough of stories, Phœbus. (5) Tune your lyre.\". (6) \"But the ring,\" said Mabel in a whisper, as the Sun-god tuned the white strings of a sort of marble harp that lay at his feet—\"about how you know all about the ring?\". (7) \"Presently,\" the Sun-god whispered back. (8) \"Zeus must be obeyed; but ask me again before dawn, and I will tell you all I know of it.\". (9) Mabel drew back, and leaned against the comfortable knees of one Demeter—Kathleen and Psyche sat holding hands. (10) Gerald and Jimmy lay at full length, chins on elbows, gazing at the Sun-god;and even as he held the lyre, before ever his fingers began to sweep the strings, the spirit of music hung in the air, enchanting, enslaving, silencing all thought but the thought of itself, all desire but the desire to listen to it. (11) Then Phœbus struck the strings and softly plucked melody from them, and all the beautiful dreams of all the world came fluttering close with wings like doves' wings; and all the lovely thoughts that sometimes hover near, but not so near that you can catch them, now came home as to their nests in the hearts of those who listened. (12) And those who listened forgot time and space, and how to be sad, and how to be naughty, and it seemed that the whole world lay like a magic apple in the hand of each listener, and that the whole world was good and beautiful. (13) And then, suddenly, the spell was shattered. (14) Phœbus struck a broken chord, followed by an instant of silence; then he sprang up, crying, \"The dawn! (15) the dawn! (16) To your pedestals, O gods!\". (17) In an instant the whole crowd of beautiful marble people had leaped to its feet, had rushed through the belt of wood that cracked and rustled as they went, and the children heard them splash in the water beyond. (18) They heard, too, the gurgling breathing of a great beast, and knew that the dinosaurus, too, was returning to his own place. (19) Only Hermes had time, since one flies more swiftly than one swims, to hover above themfor one moment, and to whisper with a mischievous laugh:—\n\n\n\n\"In fourteen days from now, at the Temple of Strange Stones.\". (20) \"What's the secret of the ring?\". (21) gasped Mabel. (22) \"The ring is the heart of the magic,\" said Hermes. (23) \"Ask at the moonrise on the fourteenth day, and you shall know all.\". (24) With that he waved the snowy caduceus and rose in the air supported by his winged feet. (25) And as he went the seven reflected moons died out and a chill wind began to blow, a grey light grew and grew, the birds stirred and twittered, and the marble slipped away from the children like a skin that shrivels in fire, and they were statues no more, but flesh and blood children as they used to be, standing knee-deep in brambles and long coarse grass. (26) There was no smooth lawn, no marble steps, no seven-mooned fish-pond. (27) The dew lay thick on the grass and the brambles, and it was very cold. (28) \"We ought to have gone with them,\" said Mabel with chattering teeth. (29) \"We can't swim now we're not marble.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What happened to the children after the marble slipped away?\",\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077jd3px307389oabajkt", "global_key": "77acb_7_29", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Raggedy Ann Stories\n\nBook Author: Johnny Gruelle\n\nParagraph: (1) By this time, she had lost her apron and now some of her yarn hair was coming loose. (2) As Fido neared the brook, another puppy dog came running across the foot-bridge to meet him. (3) \"What have you there, Fido?\". (4) said the new puppy dog as he bounced up to Raggedy Ann. (5) \"This is Raggedy Ann,\" answered Fido. (6) \"She and I are having a lovely time playing.\". (7) You see, Fido really thought Raggedy enjoyed being tossed around and whirled high up in the air. (8) But of course she didn't. (9) However, the game didn't last much longer. (10) As Raggedy Ann hit the ground the new puppy dog caught her dress and ran with her across the bridge, Fido barking close behind him. (11) In the center of the bridge, Fido caught up with the new puppy dog and they had a lively tug-of-war with Raggedy Ann stretched between then. (12) As they pulled and tugged and flopped Raggedy Ann about, somehow she fell over the side of the bridge into the water. (13) The puppy dogs were surprised, and Fido was very sorry indeed, for he remembered how good Raggedy Ann had been to him and how she had rescued him from the dog-pound. (14) But the current carried Raggedy Ann right along and all Fido could do was to run along the bank and bark. (15) Now, you would have thought Raggedy Ann would sink, but no, she floated nicely, for she was stuffed with clean white cotton and the water didn't soak through very quickly. (16) After a while, the strange puppy and Fido grew tired of running along the bank and the strange puppy scampered home over the meadow, with his tail carried gaily over his back as if he had nothing to be ashamed of. (17) But Fido walked home very sorry indeed. (18) His little heart was broken to think that he had caused Raggedy Ann to be drowned. (19) But Raggedy Ann didn't drown—not a bit of it. (20) In fact, she even went to sleep on the brook, for the motion of the current was very soothing as it carried her along—just like being rocked by Marcella. (21) So, sleeping peacefully, Raggedy Ann drifted along with the current until she came to a pool where she lodged against a large stone. (22) Raggedy Ann tried to climb upon the stone, but by this time the water had thoroughly soaked through Raggedy Ann's nice, clean, white cotton stuffing and she was so heavy she could not climb. (23) So there she had to stay until Marcella and Daddy came along and found her. (24) You see, they had been looking for her. (25) They had found pieces of her apron all along the path and across the meadow where Fido and the strange puppy dog had shaken them from Raggedy Ann. (26) So they followed the brook until they found her. (27) When Daddy fished Raggedy Ann from the water, Marcella hugged her so tightly to her breast the water ran from Raggedy Ann and dripped all over Marcella's apron. (28) But Marcella was so glad to find Raggedy Ann again she didn't mind it a bit. (29) She just hurried home and took off all of Raggedy Ann's wet clothes and placed her on a little red chair in front of the oven door, and then brought all of the other dolls in and read a fairy tale to them while Raggedy Ann steamed and dried. (30) When Raggedy Ann was thoroughly dry, Mamma said she thought the cake must be finished and she took from the oven a lovely chocolate cake and gave Marcella a large piece to have another tea party with.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Marcella do after Raggedy Ann was dry?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"1\":

(2) Odin and Tyr were there, Vidar and Vali, Niörd, Frey, Heimdall, and Bragi. (3) The Asyniur and the Vana were also—Frigga, Freya, Iduna, Gerda, Skadi, Sif, and Nanna. (4) Thor and Loki were not at the feast, for they had left Asgard together. (5) In Frey's palace the vessels were of shining gold; they made light for the table and they moved of their own accord to serve those who were feasting. (6) All was peace and friendship there until Loki entered the feast hall. (7) Frey, smiling a welcome, showed a bench to Loki. (8) It was beside Bragi's and next to Freya's. (9) Loki did not takethe place; instead he shouted out, \"Not beside Bragi will I sit; not beside Bragi, the most craven of all the Dwellers in Asgard.\". (10) Bragi sprang up at that affront, but his wife, the mild Iduna, quieted his anger. (11) Freya turned to Loki and reproved him for speaking injurious words at a feast. (12) \"Freya,\" said Loki, \"why were you not so mild when Odur was with you? (13) Would it not have been well to have been wifely with your husband instead of breaking faith with him for the sake of a necklace that you craved of the Giant women?\". (14) Amazement fell on all at the bitterness that was in Loki's words and looks. (15) Tyr and Niörd stood up from their seats. (16) But then the voice of Odin was heard and all was still for the words of the All-Father. (17) \"Take the place beside Vidar, my silent son, O Loki,\" said Odin, \"and let thy tongue which drips bitterness be silent.\". (18) \"All the Æsir and the Vanir listen to thy words, O Odin, as if thou wert always wise and just,\" Loki said. (19) \"But must we forget that thou didst bring war into the world when thou didst fling thy spear at the envoys of the Vanir? (20) And didst thou not permit me to work craftily on the one who built the wall around Asgard for a price? (21) Thou dost speak, O Odin, and all the Æsir and the Vanir listen to thee! (22) But was it not thou who, thinking not of wisdom but of gold when a ransom had to be made, brought the witch Gulveig out of the cave where she stayed with the Dwarf's treasure? (23) Thou wert not alwayswise nor always just, O Odin, and we at the table here need not listen to thee as if always thou wert.\". (24) Then Skadi, the wife of Niörd, flung words at Loki. (25) She spoke with all the fierceness of her Giant blood. (26) \"Why should we not rise up and chase from the hall this chattering crow?\". (27) she said. (28) \"Skadi,\" said Loki, \"remember that the ransom for thy father's death has not yet been paid.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Skadi

(2) I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. (3) But then there is not so clever a man any where.”\n\n\n\n“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? (4) do the children grow? (5) I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. (6) I hope he will be calling soon. (7) He will be so pleased to see my little ones.”\n\n“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. (8) And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.”\n\n\n\n“Oh! (9) my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it. (10) Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\n\n\n\n“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have spoken to—\n\n\n\n“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I have not heard one inquiry after them.”\n\n\n\n“Oh! (11) the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them in most of your letters. (12) I hope they are quite well. (13) Good old Mrs. Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children. (14) They are always so pleased to see my children. (15) And that excellent Miss Bates! (16) such thorough worthy people! (17) How are they, sir?”\n\n“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. (18) But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago.”\n\n\n\n“How sorry I am! (19) But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. (20) Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”\n\n\n\n“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. (21) Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. (22) Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.”\n\n\n\n“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers itverysickly except—\n\n\n\n“Ah! (23) my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. (24) Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. (25) It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! (26) so far off! (27) and the air so bad!”\n\n“No, indeed—weare not at all in a bad air. (28) Our part of London is very superior to most others! (29) You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir. (30) The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. (31) We are so very airy! (32) I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: butweare so remarkably airy! (33) Mr. (34) Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”\n\n\n\n“Ah! (35) my dear, it is not like Hartfield.

(8) \"He's just round that corner,\" said Jimmy. (9) \"He's simply rolling in money. (10) He doesn't know what to do with it. (11) He's been building a horse-trough and drinking fountain with a bust of himself on top. (12) Why doesn't he build a private swimming-bath close to his bed, so that he can just roll off into it of a morning? (13) I wishIwas rich; I'd soon show him——\"\n\n\"That's a sensible wish,\" said Gerald. (14) \"I wonder we didn't think of doing that. (15) Oh, criky!\". (16) he added, and with reason. (17) For there, in the green shadows of the pine-walk, in the woodland silence, broken only by rustling leaves and the agitated breathing of the three unhappy others, Jimmy got his wish. (18) By quick but perfectly plain-to-be-seen degrees Jimmy became rich. (19) And the horrible thing was that though they could see it happening they did not know what was happening, and could not have stopped it if they had. (20) All they could see was Jimmy, their own Jimmy, whom they had larked with and quarrelled with and made it up with ever since they could remember, Jimmy continuously and horribly growing old. (21) The whole thing was over in a few seconds. (22) Yet in those few seconds they saw him grow to a youth, a young man, a middle-aged man; and then, with a sort of shivering shock, unspeakably horrible and definite, he seemed to settle down into an elderly gentleman, handsomely but rather dowdily dressed, who was looking down at them through spectacles and asking them the nearest way to the railway-station. (23) If they had not seen the change take place, in all its awful details, they would never have guessed that this stout, prosperous, elderly gentleman with the high hat, the frock-coat, and the large red seal dangling from the curve of a portly waistcoat, was their own Jimmy. (24) But, as theyhadseen it, they knew the dreadful truth. (25) \"Oh, Jimmy,don't!\". (26) cried Mabel desperately. (27) Gerald said: \"This is perfectly beastly,\" and Kathleen broke into wild weeping. (28) \"Don't cry, little girl!\". (29) said That-which-had-been-Jimmy; \"and you, boy, can't you give a civil answer to a civil question?\". (30) \"He doesn't know us!

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077k33px70738l20exuvi", "global_key": "30e94_7_41", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Middlemarch\n\nBook Author: George Eliot\n\nParagraph: (1) It is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the motive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me, because I took his money. (2) I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of corn—the business is done and can’t be undone.”\n\n\n\n“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. (3) “I understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself. (4) And that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out better ways—I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. (5) I know you meant that. (6) I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital. (7) There is no sorrow I have thought more about than that—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”\n\n\n\n“Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning of his grief. (8) “I had some ambition. (9) I meant everything to be different with me. (10) I thought I had more strength and mastery. (11) But the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”\n\n\n\n“Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you would gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you, because they would see that your purposes were pure. (12) You may still win a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and we shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a smile. (13) “That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate, mournfully. (14) “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me. (15) Still, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan which depends on me.”\n\n\n\n“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. (16) “Only think. (17) I am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too little for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too much. (18) I don’t know what to do. (19) I have seven hundred a-year of my own fortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. (20) I wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I don’t want, to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of industry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the risk would be too great. (21) So you see that what I should most rejoice at would be to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make other people’s lives better to them. (22) It makes me very uneasy—coming all to me who don’t want it.”\n\n\n\nA smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. (23) The childlike grave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was irresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding of high experience. (24) (Of lower experience such as plays a great part in the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted knowledge, little helped by her imagination.) (25) But she took the smile as encouragement of her plan. (26) “I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a tone of persuasion. (27) “The hospital would be one good; and making your life quite whole and well again would be another.”\n\n\n\nLydgate’s smile had died away. (28) “You have the goodness as well as the money to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. (29) “But—”\n\nHe hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and she sat in silent expectation. (30) At last he turned towards her and said impetuously—\n\n\n\n“Why should I not tell you? (31) you know what sort of bond marriage is.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Lydgate do while he hesitated?\",\n

(2) Raggedy Ann cried, \"for we must try to rescue Fido.\". (3) So Peterkins led the way up alleys and across streets, the dolls all pattering along behind him. (4) It was a strange procession. (5) Once a strange dog ran out at them, but Peterkins told him to mind his own business and the strange dog returned to his own yard. (6) At last they came to the dog catcher's place. (7) Some of the dogs in the pen were barking at the moon and others were whining and crying. (8) There was Fido, all covered with mud, and his pretty red ribbon dragging on the ground. (9) My, but he was glad to see the dolls and Peterkins! (10) All the dogs came to the side of thepen and twisted their heads from side to side, gazing in wonder at the queer figures of the dolls. (11) \"We will try and let you out,\" said Raggedy Ann. (12) At this all the dogs barked joyfully. (13) Then Raggedy Ann, the other dolls and Peterkins went to the gate. (14) The catch was too high for Raggedy Ann to reach, but Peterkins held Raggedy Ann in his mouth and stood up on his hind legs so that she could raise the catch. (15) When the catch was raised, the dogs were so anxious to get out they pushed and jumped against the gate so hard it flew open, knocking Peterkins and Raggedy Ann into the mud. (16) Such a yapping and barking was never heard in the neighborhood as when the dogs swarmed out of the enclosure, jumping over one another and scrambling about in the mad rush out the gate. (17) Fido picked himself up from where he had been rolled by the large dogs and helped Raggedy Ann to her feet. (18) He, Peterkins, and all the dolls ran after the pack of dogs, turning the corner just as the dog catcher came running out of the house in his nightgown to see what was causing the trouble. (19) He stopped in astonishment when he saw the string of dolls in white nighties pattering down the alley, for he could not imagine what they were. (20) Well, you may be sure the dolls thanked Peterkins for his kind assistance and they and Fido ran on home, for a faint light was beginning to show in the east where the sun was getting ready to come up. (21) When they got to their own home they found an old chair out in the yard and after a great deal of work they finally dragged it to the window and thus managed to get into the nursery again. (22) Fido was very grateful to Raggedy Ann and the other dolls and before he went to his basket he gave them each a lick on the cheek. (23) The dolls lost no time in scrambling into bed and pulling up the covers, for they were very sleepy, but just as they were dozing off, Raggedy Ann raised herself and said, \"If my legs and arms were not stuffed with nice clean cotton I feel sure they would ache, but being stuffed with nice clean white cotton, they do not ache and I could not feel happier if my body were stuffed with sunshine, for I know how pleased and happy Mistress will be in the morning when she discovers Fido asleep in his own little basket, safe and sound at home.\". (24) And as the dollies by this time were all asleep, Raggedy Ann pulled the sheet up to her chin and smiled so hard she ripped two stitches out of the back of her rag head.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077ke3px90738yggjcvu9", "global_key": "fd6ac_7_36", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Middlemarch\n\nBook Author: George Eliot\n\nParagraph: (1) He was in a state of uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should condemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of herownemotion. (2) She looked as if there were a spell upon her, keeping her motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands, while some intense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes. (3) Seeing that she did not put out her hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said with embarrassment, “I am so grateful to you for seeing me.”\n\n\n\n“I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at command. (4) It did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but he went on to say what he had made up his mind to say. (5) “I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon. (6) I have been punished for my impatience. (7) You know—every one knows now—a painful story about my parentage. (8) I knew of it before I went away, and I always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met again.”\n\n\n\nThere was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her hands, but immediately folded them over each other. (9) “But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. (10) “I wished you to know that something connected with it—something which happened before I went away, helped to bring me down here again. (11) At least I thought it excused my coming. (12) It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to apply some money to a public purpose—some money which he had thought of giving me. (13) Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s credit that he privately offered me compensation for an old injury: he offered to give me a good income to make amends; but I suppose you know the disagreeable story?”\n\n\n\nWill looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his manner was gathering some of the defiant courage with which he always thought of this fact in his destiny. (14) He added, “You know that it must be altogether painful to me.”\n\n\n\n“Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily. (15) “I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. (16) I was sure that you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will. (17) Why should he mind saying anything of that sort to her now? (18) She knew that he had avowed his love for her. (19) “I felt that”—he broke off, nevertheless. (20) “You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea, her face brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its beautiful stem. (21) “I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth create a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in others,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old way, and looking with a grave appeal into her eyes. (22) “If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to you,” said Dorothea, fervidly. (23) “Nothing could have changed me but—” her heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that you were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.”\n\n\n\n“You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,” said Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers. (24) “I mean, in my truth to you. (25) When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t care about anything that was left. (26) I thought it was all over with me, and there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.”\n\n\n\n“I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection. (27) He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob. (28) But he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have done for the portrait of a Royalist. (29) Still it was difficult to loose the hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed her, looked and moved away. (30) “See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,” she said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only a dim sense of what she was doing.\n\n\n\nQuestion:

(2) Before the Hall he shouted out the Volsung name, and King Alv felt as he watched him that this youth was a match for a score of men, and Hiordis, his mother, saw the blue flame of his eyes and thought to herself that his way through the world would be as the way of the eagle through the air. (3) Having shown himself before the Hall, Sigurd dismounted from Grani, and stroked and caressed him with his hands and told him that now he might go back andtake pasture with the herd. (4) The proud horse breathed fondly over Sigurd and bounded away. (5) Then Sigurd strode on until he came to the hut in the forest where he worked with the cunning smith Regin. (6) No one was in the hut when he entered. (7) But over the anvil, in the smoke of the smithy fire, there was a work of Regin's hands. (8) Sigurd looked upon it, and a hatred for the thing that was shown rose up in him. (9) The work of Regin's hands was a shield, a great shield of iron. (10) Hammered out on that shield and colored with red and brown colors was the image of a Dragon, a Dragon lengthening himself out of a cave. (11) Sigurd thought it was the image of the most hateful thing in the world, and the light of the smithy fire falling on it, and the smoke of the smithy fire rising round it, made it seem verily a Dragon living in his own element of fire and reek. (12) While he was still gazing on the loathly image, Regin, the cunning smith, came into the smithy. (13) He stood by the wall and he watched Sigurd. (14) His back was bent; his hair fell over his eyes that were all fiery, and he looked like a beast that runs behind the hedges. (15) \"Aye, thou dost look on Fafnir the Dragon, son of the Volsungs,\" he said to Sigurd. (16) \"Mayhap it is thou who wilt slay him.\". (17) \"I would not strive with such a beast. (18) He is all horrible to me,\" Sigurd said. (19) \"With a good sword thou mightst slay him and win for thyself more renown than ever thy fathers had,\" Regin whispered. (20) \"I shall win renown as my fathers won renown, in battle with men and in conquest of kingdoms,\" Sigurd said. (21) \"Thou art not a true Volsung or thou wouldst gladly go where most danger and dread is,\" said Regin. (22) \"Thou hast heard of Fafnir the Dragon, whose image I have wrought here. (23) If thou dost ride to the crest of the hills thou mayst look across to the desolate land where Fafnir has his haunt.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

(2) Is nothing due to me on that score? (3) Let us sit down. (4) You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. (5) I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. (6) I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\n\n\n\n“Thatwill make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect onme.”\n\n\n\n“I will not be interrupted! (7) Hear me in silence. (8) My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. (9) They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. (10) Their fortune on both sides is splendid. (11) They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? (12) the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune! (13) Is this to be endured? (14) But it must not, shall not be! (15) If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n\n\n\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. (16) He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.”\n\n\n\n“True. (17) Youarea gentleman’s daughter. (18) But what was your mother? (19) Who are your uncles and aunts? (20) Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.”\n\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing toyou.”\n\n\n\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\n\n\n\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment’s deliberation,—\n\n\n\n“I am not.”\n\n\n\nLady Catherine seemed pleased. (21) “And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\n\n\n\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n\n\n\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. (22) I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. (23) But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. (24) I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.”\n\n\n\n“And I certainlynevershall give it. (25) I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. (26) Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise maketheirmarriage at all more probable? (27) Supposing him to be attached to me, wouldmyrefusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077kv3pxc0738lb4hf2lu", "global_key": "7bb8b_7_37", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Middlemarch\n\nBook Author: George Eliot\n\nParagraph: (1) They only came forth gracefully on solicitation. (2) “As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand tenderly on both of hers. (3) “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the lashes? (4) Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. (5) That is unloving.”\n\n“Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? (6) They are every-day things:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”\n\n\n\n“Family annoyances. (7) Don’t fear speaking. (8) I guess them.”\n\n“Papa has been more irritable lately. (9) Fred makes him angry, and this morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his whole education away, and do something quite beneath him. (10) And besides—”\n\nRosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush. (11) Lydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their engagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at this moment. (12) He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage them. (13) “I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond continued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should certainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”\n\n\n\n“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily. (14) “I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond, recovering her calmness at the touching of this chord. (15) “God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. (16) This constancy of purpose in the right place was adorable. (17) He went on:—\n\n“It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be given up. (18) You are of age, and I claim you as mine. (19) If anything is done to make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”\n\n\n\nAn unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his, and the radiance seemed to light up all his future with mild sunshine. (20) Ideal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you are invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a paradise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed to be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting, more or less. (21) “Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. (22) “I have taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not? (23) You will not mind about new clothes. (24) Those can be bought afterwards.”\n\n“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling with more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity. (25) “This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought after marriage.”\n\n\n\n“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was tormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from speedy marriage. (26) “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of happiness even than this—being continually together, independent of others, and ordering our lives as we will. (27) Come, dear, tell me how soon you can be altogether mine.”\n\n\n\nThere was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she would be injuring him by any fantastic delays. (28) Rosamond became serious too, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many intricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order to give an answer that would at least be approximative. (29) “Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate, releasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What is Rosamond considering while trying to decide on a timeline?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 25\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 26\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 28\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 29\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"4\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 28 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that Rosamond was meditative and considering various details like lace-edging and hosiery, which are related to her wedding preparations.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who did Lydgate speak to about hiding feelings?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it directly shows Lydgate speaking to someone and mentioning the impossibility of hiding feelings from him.

(2) Mama, Daddy and a strange man were talking in the living room and Daddy introduced Marcella to the stranger. (3) The stranger was a large man with kindly eyes and a cheery smile, as pleasant as Raggedy Ann's. (4) He took Marcella upon his knee and ran his fingers through her curls as he talked to Daddy and Mamma, so, of course, Raggedy Ann liked him from the beginning. (5) \"I have two little girls,\" he told Marcella. (6) \"Their names are Virginia and Doris, and one time when we were at the sea-shore they were playing in the sand and they covered up Freddy, Doris' boy-doll in the sand. (7) They were playing that Freddy was in bathing and that he wanted to be covered with the clean white sand, just as the other bathers did. (8) And when they had covered Freddy they took their little pails and shovels and went farther down the beach to play and forgot all about Freddy. (9) \"Now when it came time for us to go home, Virginia and Doris remembered Freddy and ran down to get him, but the tide had come in and Freddy was 'way out under the waterand they could not find him. (10) Virginia and Doris were very sad and they talked of Freddy all the way home.\". (11) \"It was too bad they forgot Freddy,\" said Marcella. (12) \"Yes, indeed it was!\". (13) the new friend replied as he took Raggedy Ann up and made her dance on Marcella's knee. (14) \"But it turned out all right after all, for do you know what happened to Freddy?\". (15) \"No, what did happen to him?\". (16) Marcella asked. (17) \"Well, first of all, when Freddy was covered with the sand, he enjoyed it immensely. (18) And he did not mind it so much when the tide came up over him, for he felt Virginia and Doris would return and get him. (19) \"But presently Freddy felt the sand above him move as if someone was digging him out. (20) Soon his head was uncovered and he could look right up through the pretty green water, and what do you think was happening?\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

Nesbit\n\nParagraph: (1) \"Nor yet me,\" said Jimmy. (2) \"It's the story of how we got the ring that they want,\" said Mabel in a hurry. (3) \"I'll tell it if you like. (4) Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mabel,\" she added yet more hastily, and went on with the tale—all the tale of the enchanted castle, or almost all, that you have read in these pages. (5) The marble Olympians listened enchanted—almost as enchanted as the castle itself, and the soft moonlit moments fell past like pearls dropping into a deep pool. (6) \"And so,\" Mabel ended abruptly, \"Kathleen wished for the boys and the Lord Hermes fetched them and here we all are.\". (7) A burst of interested comment and question blossomed out round the end of the story, suddenly broken off short by Mabel. (8) \"But,\" said she, brushing it aside, as it grew thinner, \"now we wantyouto tellus.\". (9) \"To tell you——?\". (10) \"How you come to be alive, and how youknow about the ring—and everything youdoknow.\". (11) \"Everything I know?\". (12) Phœbus laughed—it was to him that she had spoken—and not his lips only but all the white lips curled in laughter. (13) \"The span of your life, my earth-child, would not contain the words I should speak, to tell you all I know.\". (14) \"Well, about the ring anyhow, and how you come alive,\" said Gerald; \"you see, it's very puzzling to us.\". (15) \"Tell them, Phœbus,\" said the dearest lady in the world; \"don't tease the children.\". (16) So Phœbus, leaning back against a heap of leopard-skins that Dionysus had lavishly plucked from a spruce fir, told. (17) \"All statues,\" he said, \"can come alive when the moon shines, if they so choose. (18) But statues that are placed in ugly cities do not choose. (19) Why should they weary themselves with the contemplation of the hideous?\". (20) \"Quite so,\" said Gerald politely, to fill the pause. (21) \"In your beautiful temples,\" the Sun-god went on, \"the images of your priests and of your warriors who lie cross-legged on their tombs come alive and walk in their marble about their temples, and through the woods and fields. (22) But only on one night in all the year can any see them. (23) You have beheld us because you held the ring, and are of one brotherhood with us in your marble, but on that one night all may behold us.\". (24) \"And when is that?\". (25) Gerald asked, again polite, in a pause. (26) \"At the festival of the harvest,\" said Phœbus. (27) \"On that night as the moon rises it strikes one beam of perfect light on to the altar in certain temples. (28) One of these temples is in Hellas, buried under the fall of a mountain which Zeus, being angry, hurled down upon it. (29) One is in this land; it is in this great garden.\". (30) \"Then,\" said Gerald, much interested, \"if we were to come up to that temple on that night, we could see you, even without being statues or having the ring? (31) \".\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What happens when the moon rises at certain temples?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n

(2) His mind also was tumultuously busy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather wildly that something must happen to hinder their parting—some miracle, clearly nothing in their own deliberate speech. (3) Yet, after all, had she any love for him? (4) he could not pretend to himself that he would rather believe her to be without that pain. (5) He could not deny that a secret longing for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his words. (6) Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. (7) Dorothea was raising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her footman came to say—\n\n\n\n“The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.”\n\n\n\n“Presently,” said Dorothea. (8) Then turning to Will, she said, “I have some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”\n\n\n\n“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing towards her. (9) “The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.”\n\n\n\n“You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone, feeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak. (10) She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking, for her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself. (11) Their eyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in hers there was only sadness. (12) He turned away and took his portfolio under his arm. (13) “I have never done you injustice. (14) Please remember me,” said Dorothea, repressing a rising sob. (15) “Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. (16) “As if I were not in danger of forgetting everything else.”\n\n\n\nHe had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it impelled him to go away without pause. (17) It was all one flash to Dorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the door—the sense that he was no longer there. (18) She sank into the chair, and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were hurrying upon her. (19) Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train behind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from. (20) They were parted all the same, but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt her strength return—she could think of him unrestrainedly. (21) At that moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and being loved excluded sorrow. (22) It was as if some hard icy pressure had melted, and her consciousness had room to expand: her past was come back to her with larger interpretation. (23) The joy was not the less—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of the irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder to imagine in any eye or from any lips. (24) He had acted so as to defy reproach, and make wonder respectful. (25) Any one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying thought within her. (26) Just as when inventive power is working with glad ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write her memoranda. (27) She spoke her last words to the housekeeper in cheerful tones, and when she seated herself in the carriage her eyes were bright and her cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. (28) She threw back the heavy “weepers,” and looked before her, wondering which road Will had taken. (29) It was in her nature to be proud that he was blameless, and through all her feelings there ran this vein—“I was right to defend him.”\n\n\n\nThe coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his desk, and wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled along quickly. (30) Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the great clouds that sailed in masses. (31) The earth looked like a happy place under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she might overtake Will and see him once more.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Why did the coachman drive the grays at a good pace?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 28\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 29\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 30\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 31\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"3\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 29 is the correct answer to the question because it explains that Mr. Casaubon, who was unenjoying and impatient away from his desk, influenced the coachman\\\"s driving pace as he wanted to get to the end of all journeys quickly.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"What was Will feeling about their parting?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it describes Will\\\"s feelings and thoughts about the impending parting, noting that he felt \\\"rather wildly that something must happen to hinder their parting.\\\"\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"What was the effect of the actions he took?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 22\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 23\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 24\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 25\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 26\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"3\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 24 is the correct answer to the question because it describes the consequence of his actions, stating that he acted in a way that defied reproach and made wonder respectful.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"What did Dorothea say to her footman?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 5\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 6\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 7\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 8\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"4\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 7 is the correct answer to the question because it directly quotes Dorothea\\\"s response to her footman about when she would like to start with the horses.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"What was Dorothea\\\"s reaction after Will left?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 17\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 18\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 19\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 20\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 21\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 18 is the correct answer to the question because it details Dorothea\\\"s immediate reaction after Will left, describing how she sat like a statue, overwhelmed by emotions and images.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_6\": \"What did Dorothea say about her departure plans?\",\n            \"answer_choices_6\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 7\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 8\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 9\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 10\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 11\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_6\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"1\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 7 is the correct answer to the question because it is the only sentence that mentions Dorothea communicating about her plans to leave, specifically telling the footman that she will start \\\"presently.\\\"\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_7\": \"What did Will do after feeling angry?\",\n            \"answer_choices_7\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 12\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 13\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 14\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 15\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 16\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_7\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"5\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 16 is the correct answer to the question because it explains Will\\\"s reaction after feeling a movement of anger against Dorothea.

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077ll3pxg0738mo5fcpi5", "global_key": "76bb4_7_14", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nBook Author: Alexandre Dumas\n\nParagraph: (1) However, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard. (2) He again struck it, and with greater force. (3) Then a singular thing occurred. (4) As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone. (5) The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite. (6) Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices. (7) It was there he must dig. (8) But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him. (9) This last proof, instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint. (10) The island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean. (11) Dantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the cavern. (12) The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. (13) After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet. (14) He had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one. (15) The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. (16) At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto. (17) The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. (18) He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on. (19) At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. (20) But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness. (21) He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty. (22) The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. (23) The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided. (24) He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe. (25) At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance. (26) Never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. (27) Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale. (28) He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound. (29) “It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did the pickaxe strike against on the fifth or sixth

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077lr3pxh0738xgcbuizd", "global_key": "f31dd_7_16", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nBook Author: Alexandre Dumas\n\nParagraph: (1) The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. (2) They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay. (3) The soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. (4) In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon. (5) At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor. (6) The prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. (7) Dantès folded his hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently. (8) The boat continued her voyage. (9) They had passed the Tête de Mort, were now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. (10) This manœuvre was incomprehensible to Dantès. (11) “Whither are you taking me?” asked he. (12) “You will soon know.”\n\n“But still——”\n\n\n\n“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent. (13) The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. (14) The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point. (15) He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. (16) Besides, had not the deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? (17) Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him? (18) He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness. (19) They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. (20) It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercédès dwelt. (21) How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her? (22) One light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ chamber. (23) Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. (24) A loud cry could be heard by her. (25) But pride restrained him and he did not utter it. (26) What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman? (27) He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. (28) An intervening elevation of land hid the light. (29) Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Why did the prisoner not shout?\",\n

(2) “‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow. (3) “The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road. (4) So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall. (5) “There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back. (6) “‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?’\n\n\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day. (7) I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.’\n\n\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.’\n\n\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for the whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders. (8) “It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest. (9) However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market. (10) After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way. (11) “‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed. (12) “‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy. (13) Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. (14) Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish. (15) You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you. (16) Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend. (17) But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? (18) Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. (19) Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing. (20) Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him. (21) “‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he inquired in a shy and timid voice. (22) “‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n\n\n“‘Oh! (23) on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn. (24) “He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on. (25) “‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the Miller in a cheery voice. (26) “‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder. (27) “‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.’\n\n\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege. (28) But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n\n\n“‘Oh! (29) they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more pains.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who fixed the roof?\",\n

(2) “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. (3) Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married.”\n\n\n\n“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. (4) I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.”\n\n\n\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. (5) Her father fondly replied, “Ah! (6) my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. (7) Pray do not make any more matches.”\n\n“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. (8) It is the greatest amusement in the world! (9) And after such success, you know! (10) Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. (11) Oh dear, no! (12) Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. (13) Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. (14) Oh no! (15) Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. (16) Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him. (17) All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it. (18) “Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. (19) I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.”\n\n\n\n“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley. (20) “Success supposes endeavour. (21) Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. (22) A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! (23) But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? (24) Where is your merit? (25) What are you proud of? (26) You made a lucky guess; andthatis all that can be said.”\n\n\n\n“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? (27) I pity you. (28) I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. (29) There is always some talent in it. (30) And as to my poor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. (31) You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all. (32) If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n

(2) The little light in the lodge had long been extinct. (3) It might be expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in Monte Cristo’s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. (4) It would be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the back staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room. (5) The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes. (6) As the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding, was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew what to expect. (7) A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. (8) The count felt his heart beat more rapidly. (9) Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream and a reality, between the project and the execution. (10) However, Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali, who, understanding that danger was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master. (11) Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies. (12) The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing-room. (13) He fixed his eyes on that window—he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside, then the square cracked without falling. (14) Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its hinges, and a man entered. (15) He was alone. (16) “That’s a daring rascal,” whispered the count. (17) At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. (18) He turned; Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street. (19) “I see!” said he, “there are two of them; one does the work while the other stands guard.” He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room. (20) The glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms stretched out before him. (21) At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings. (22) There were two doors; he bolted them both. (23) When he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings. (24) It was only a precaution. (25) The nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose with full security. (26) Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed it on a stand, then went straight to the secretaire, felt the lock, and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing. (27) But the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies. (28) The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt. (29) “Ah, ha,” whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment, “he is only a thief.”\n\n\n\nBut the man in the dark could not find the right key.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n

(2) I’ve got to break it to you, my dear.” Here Mr. Brooke looked at Celia—“You’ve no notion what it is, you know. (3) And, Chettam, it will annoy you uncommonly—but, you see, you have not been able to hinder it, any more than I have. (4) There’s something singular in things: they come round, you know.”\n\n\n\n“It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think of her sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. (5) She had seated herself on a low stool against her husband’s knee. (6) “For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James. (7) “Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a sort of will to make things worse.”\n\n\n\n“Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily. (8) “Butwhatis worse?”\n\n“Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a frightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. (9) Sir James was almost white with anger, but he did not speak. (10) “Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. (11) “Not toyoungLadislaw?”\n\nMr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell into a prudential silence. (12) “You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm towards her husband. (13) “Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever.Yousupposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.”\n\n\n\n“So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector, quietly. (14) “When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear any one else speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself. (15) “Yesterday,” said Mr. Brooke, meekly. (16) “I went to Lowick. (17) Dorothea sent for me, you know. (18) It had come about quite suddenly—neither of them had any idea two days ago—not any idea, you know. (19) There’s something singular in things. (20) But Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use opposing. (21) I put it strongly to her. (22) I did my duty, Chettam. (23) But she can act as she likes, you know.”\n\n“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year ago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he needed something strong to say. (24) “Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said Celia. (25) “Be reasonable, Chettam. (26) Look at the affair more quietly,” said Mr. Cadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so overmastered by anger. (27) “That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of right—when the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James, still in his white indignation. (28) “It is perfectly scandalous. (29) If Ladislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country at once, and never shown his face in it again.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

(2) “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.”\n\n\n\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n\n\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. (3) Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. (4) No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. (5) These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not. (6) Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. (7) She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. (8) Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. (9) He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. (10) He did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill morebirds on the first of September than anybody else in the country. (11) One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,—\n\n\n\n“Lizzy, I never gaveyouan account of my wedding, I believe. (12) You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. (13) Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”\n\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.”\n\n\n\n“La! (14) You are so strange! (15) But I must tell you how it went off. (16) We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that parish. (17) And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock. (18) My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. (19) “Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! (20) I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. (21) And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. (22) However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. (23) I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat. (24) “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. (25) If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. (26) Not one party, or scheme, or anything! (27) To be sure, London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. (28) “Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. (29) And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. (30) Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Why was the narrator frightened?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"26\": \"Sentence 26\",\n                \"27\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"28\": \"Sentence 28\",\n                \"29\": \"Sentence 29\",\n                \"30\": \"Sentence 30\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"30\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 30 is the correct answer to the question because it describes the narrator\\\"s fear of not being able to get married that day if they were late, due to her uncle being needed to give her away at the ceremony.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who was planning to find husbands for her sisters?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it mentions the character expressing her intention to find husbands for her sisters before the winter is over.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"What was the narrator thinking about while dressing?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"21\": \"Sentence 21\",\n                \"22\": \"Sentence 22\",\n                \"23\": \"Sentence 23\",\n                \"24\": \"Sentence 24\",\n                \"25\": \"Sentence 25\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"22\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 22 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that the narrator was thinking of Wickham while she was dressing.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"Who regretted the short stay of Mr. Wickham?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\",\n                \"6\": \"Sentence 6\",\n                \"7\": \"Sentence 7\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"4\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 4 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly mentions that Mrs. Bennet was the only person who regretted the short stay, emphasizing her efforts to make the most of the time by visiting and organizing parties.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"Where were Wickham\\\"s lodgings located?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"16\": \"Sentence 16\",\n                \"17\": \"Sentence 17\",\n                \"18\": \"Sentence 18\",\n                \"19\": \"Sentence 19\",\n                \"20\": \"Sentence 20\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"16\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 16 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions the location of Wickham\\\"s lodgings, which were in St. Clement\\\"s parish.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_6\": \"Who was exceedingly fond of Wickham?\",\n            \"answer_choices_6\": {\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\",\n                \"6\": \"Sentence 6\",\n                \"7\": \"Sentence 7\",\n                \"8\": \"Sentence 8\",\n                \"9\": \"Sentence 9\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_6\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"8\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 8 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically states that \\\"Lydia was exceedingly fond of him,\\\" directly identifying Lydia\\\"s strong affection for Wickham.

(2) First, there was the Vanir. (3) When the Gods who were called the Æsir came to the mountain on which they built Asgard, they found other beings there. (4) These were not wicked and ugly like the Giants; they were beautiful and friendly; the Vanir they were named. (5) Although they were beautiful and friendly the Vanir had no thought of making the world more beautiful or more happy. (6) In that way they differed from the Æsir who had such a thought. (7) The Æsir made peace with them, and they lived together in friendship, and the Vanir came to do things that helped the Æsir to make the world more beautiful and more happy. (8) Freya, whom the Giant wanted to take away with the Sun and the Moon as a reward for the building of the wall round Asgard, was of the Vanir.The other beings of the Vanir were Frey, who was the brother of Freya, and Niörd, who was their father. (9) On the earth below there were other beings—the dainty Elves, who danced and fluttered about, attending to the trees and flowers and grasses. (10) The Vanir were permitted to rule over the Elves. (11) Then below the earth, in caves and hollows, there was another race, the Dwarfs or Gnomes, little, twisted creatures, who were both wicked and ugly, but who were the best craftsmen in the world. (12) In the days when neither the Æsir nor the Vanir were friendly to him Loki used to go down to Svartheim, the Dwarfs' dwelling below the earth. (13) And now that he was commanded to restore to Sif the beauty of her hair, Loki thought of help he might get from the Dwarfs. (14) Down, down, through the winding passages in the earth he went, and he came at last to where the Dwarfs who were most friendly to him were working in their forges. (15) All the Dwarfs were master-smiths, and when he came upon his friends he found them working hammer and tongs, beating metals into many shapes. (16) He watched them for a while and took note of the things they were making. (17) One was a spear, so well balanced and made that it would hit whatever mark it was thrown at no matter how bad the aim the thrower had. (18) The other was a boat that could sail on any sea, but that could be folded up so that it would go into one's pocket. (19) The spear was called Gungnir and the boat was called Skidbladnir. (20) Loki made himself very agreeable to the Dwarfs, praising their work and promising them things that only the Dwellers in Asgard could give, things that the Dwarfs longed to possess. (21) He talked to them till the little, ugly folk thought that they would come to own Asgard and all that was in it. (22) At last Loki said to them, \"Have you got a bar of fine gold that you can hammer into threads—into threads so fine that they will be like the hair of Sif, Thor's wife? (23) Only the Dwarfs could make a thing so wonderful. (24) Ah, there is the bar of gold. (25) Hammer it into those fine threads, and the Gods themselves will be jealous of your work.\". (26) Flattered by Loki's speeches, the Dwarfs who were in the forge took up the bar of fine gold and flung it into the fire. (27) Then taking it out and putting it upon their anvil they worked on the bar with their tiny hammers until they beat it into threads that were as fine as the hairs of one's head. (28) But that was not enough. (29) They had to be as fine as the hairs on Sif's head, and these were finer than anything else.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did the Dwarfs

(2) I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. (3) Come, Jane, take my other arm.”\n\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. (4) “Happy couple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing:—“How well they suit one another! (5) Very lucky—marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place! (6) They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! (7) Peculiarly lucky! (8) for as to any real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. (9) It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment. (10) Short of that, it is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. (11) How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!”\n\n\n\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own confederates, spoke now. (12) “Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a cough. (13) Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen. (14) “You were speaking,” said he, gravely. (15) She recovered her voice. (16) “I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent. (17) A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. (18) I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.”\n\n\n\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone,\n\n\n\n“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. (19) Will you? (20) (turning to Emma.) (21) Will you chuse a wife for me? (22) I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you. (23) You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at his father). (24) Find some body for me. (25) I am in no hurry. (26) Adopt her, educate her.”\n\n“And make her like myself.”\n\n\n\n“By all means, if you can.”\n\n\n\n“Very well. (27) I undertake the commission. (28) You shall have a charming wife.”\n\n“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. (29) I care for nothing else. (30) I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. (31) Remember.”\n\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. (32) It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling. (33) Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did the speaker promise to do before returning?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 29\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 30\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 31\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 32\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 33\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 30 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions the speaker\\\"s intention to go abroad for a couple of years before returning.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who felt tired of exploring one spot?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly mentions that the speaker is \\\"really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\\\" This specifies who felt tired, aligning directly with the question asked.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"What characteristic must the wife have?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 24\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 25\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 26\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 28\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"5\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 28 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically describes the characteristics the wife should have, including being \\\"very lively\\\" and having \\\"hazle eyes\\\".

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077n23pxp07382awjo47y", "global_key": "33189_7_28", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Raggedy Ann Stories\n\nBook Author: Johnny Gruelle\n\nParagraph: (1) How could you!\". (2) Marcella had sobbed as she snatched the flattened Raggedy Ann from the bewildered Dinah's hand. (3) Mamma patted Marcella's hand and soon coaxed her to quit sobbing. (4) When Dinah explained that the first she knew of Raggedy being in the wash was when she took her from the boiler, Marcella began crying again. (5) \"It was all my fault, Mamma!\". (6) she cried. (7) \"I remember now that I threw dear old Raggedy Ann from me as I ran out the door and she must have fallen in the clothes hamper! (8) Oh dear! (9) Oh dear!\". (10) and she hugged Raggedy Ann tight. (11) Mamma did not tell Marcella that she had been cross andnaughty for she knew Marcella felt very sorry. (12) Instead Mamma put her arms around her and said,\n\n\"Just see how Raggedy Ann takes it! (13) She doesn't seem to be unhappy!\". (14) And when Marcella brushed her tears away and looked at Raggedy Ann, flat as a pancake and with a cheery smile upon her painted face, she had to laugh. (15) And Mamma and Dinah had to laugh, too, for Raggedy Ann's smile was almost twice as broad as it had been before. (16) \"Just let me hang Miss Raggedy on the line in the bright sunshine for half an hour,\" said Dinah, \"and you won't know her when she comes off!\". (17) So Raggedy Ann was pinned to the clothes-line, out in the bright sunshine, where she swayed and twisted in the breeze and listened to the chatter of the robins in a nearby tree. (18) Every once in a while Dinah went out and rolled and patted Raggedy until her cotton stuffing was soft and dry and fluffy and her head and arms and legs were nice and round again. (19) Then she took Raggedy Ann into the house and showed Marcella and Mamma how clean and sweet she was. (20) Marcella took Raggedy Ann right up to the nursery and told all the dolls just what had happened and how sorry she was that she had been so cross and peevish when she dressed them. (21) And while the dolls said never a word they looked at their little mistress with love in their eyes as she sat in the little red rocking chair and held Raggedy Ann tightly in her arms. (22) And Raggedy Ann's remaining shoe-button eye looked up at her little mistress in rather a saucy manner, but upon her face was the same old smile of happiness, good humor and love.\n\n\n\nQuestion:

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077nb3pxq0738g6ux36q9", "global_key": "d662c_7_39", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Middlemarch\n\nBook Author: George Eliot\n\nParagraph: (1) “If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee.”—Ecclesiasticus. (2) Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager’s room at the Bank, about three o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there, when the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting, and also that Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him. (3) “By all means,” said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. (4) “Pray sit down, Mr. Garth,” continued the banker, in his suavest tone. (5) “I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. (6) I know you count your minutes.”\n\n“Oh,” said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as he seated himself and laid his hat on the floor. (7) He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers droop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow. (8) Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be important, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying of some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down, as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of air and light on that spot. (9) It was by propositions of this kind that Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they had got on well together. (10) When he spoke again, however, it was to say, in rather a subdued voice—\n\n\n\n“I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”\n\n\n\n“You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there myself yesterday. (11) Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”\n\n“Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a stranger, who is very ill, I think. (12) He wants a doctor, and I came to tell you of that. (13) His name is Raffles.”\n\nHe saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. (14) On this subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly on the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken. (15) “Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips trembled a little. (16) “Do you know how he came there?”\n\n“I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. (17) He had got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning from the toll-house, and I overtook him. (18) He remembered seeing me with you once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. (19) I saw he was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under shelter. (20) And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for him.” Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended, and rose slowly from his seat. (21) “Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment. (22) “Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr. Lydgate’s as you pass—or stay! (23) he may at this hour probably be at the Hospital. (24) I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this instant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”\n\n\n\nBulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the commission to his man. (25) When he returned, Caleb was standing as before with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other. (26) In Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only spoke to Garth of his illness. (27) Garth may wonder, as he must have done before, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he will know nothing. (28) And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”\n\n\n\nHe longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been to betray fear.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who was holding his hat in one hand?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"24\": \"Option 24\",\n                \"25\": \"Option 25\",\n                \"26\": \"Option 26\",\n                \"27\": \"Option 27\",\n                \"28\": \"Option 28\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"25\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 25 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly mentions Caleb holding his hat with one hand.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"What did the clerk inform Mr. Bulstrode about?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Option 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Option 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Option 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Option 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Option 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it mentions that the clerk informed Mr. Bulstrode about his horse waiting and Mr. Garth wanting to speak with him.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"Where might Mr. Garth find Mr. Lydgate at this hour?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"19\": \"Option 19\",\n                \"20\": \"Option 20\",\n                \"21\": \"Option 21\",\n                \"22\": \"Option 22\",\n                \"23\": \"Option 23\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"23\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 23 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically suggests that Mr. Lydgate might be at the Hospital at this hour.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"Who invited Caleb to sit down?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"3\": \"Option 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Option 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Option 5\",\n                \"6\": \"Option 6\",\n                \"7\": \"Option 7\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"4\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 4 is the correct answer to the question because it describes the banker (Bulstrode) inviting Mr. Garth (Caleb) to sit down by saying, \\\"Pray sit down, Mr. Garth.\\\"\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"Who took the man to the location?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"14\": \"Option 14\",\n                \"15\": \"Option 15\",\n                \"16\": \"Option 16\",\n                \"17\": \"Option 17\",\n                \"18\": \"Option 18\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"16\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 16 specifically mentions that Caleb himself took the man in his gig, answering the question directly.

(2) The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. (3) They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent. (4) Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. (5) They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road withsome abruptness wound. (6) It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. (7) Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. (8) Elizabeth was delighted. (9) She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. (10) They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! (11) They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. (12) She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. (13) On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. (14) The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. (15) They followed her into the dining-parlour. (16) It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. (17) Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. (18) The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. (19) Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. (20) As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; butfrom every window there were beauties to be seen. (21) The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,—with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings. (22) “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! (23) With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! (24) Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. (25) But, no,” recollecting herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\n\n\n\nThis was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret. (26) She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it. (27) At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who

(2) I can see clearly but I cannot see far. (3) Now let me go back to my sleep with the Dead.\". (4) \"Volva, prophetess!\". (5) Odin cried out again. (6) But the voice from amongst the shrouded ones said, \"Thou canst not wake me any more until the fires of Muspelheim blaze above my head.\". (7) Then there was silence in the field of the Dead, and Odin turned Sleipner, his steed, and for four days, through the gloom and silence, he journeyed back to Asgard. (8) Frigga had felt the fear that Odin had felt. (9) She looked toward Baldur, and the shade of Hela came between her and her son. (10) But then she heard the birds sing in the Peace Stead and she knew that none of all the things in the world would injure Baldur. (11) And to make it sure she went to all the things that could hurt him and from each of them she took an oath that it would not injure Baldur, the Well-Beloved. (12) She took an oath from fire and from water, from iron and from all metals, from earths and stones and great trees, from birds and beasts and creeping things, from poisons and diseases. (13) Very readily they all gave the oath that they would work no injury on Baldur. (14) Then when Frigga went back and told what she had accomplished the gloom that had lain on Asgard lifted. (15) Baldur would be spared to them. (16) Hela might have a place prepared in her dark habitation, but neither fire norwater, nor iron nor any metals, nor earths nor stones nor great woods, nor birds nor beasts nor creeping things, nor poisons nor diseases, would help her to bring him down. (17) \"Hela has no arms to draw you to her,\" the Æsir and the Vanir cried to Baldur. (18) Hope was renewed for them and they made games to honor Baldur. (19) They had him stand in the Peace Stead and they brought against him all the things that had sworn to leave him hurtless. (20) And neither the battle-axe flung full at him, nor the stone out of the sling, nor the burning brand, nor the deluge of water would injure the beloved of Asgard. (21) The Æsir and the Vanir laughed joyously to see these things fall harmlessly from him while a throng came to join them in the games; Dwarfs and friendly Giants. (22) But Loki the Hater came in with that throng. (23) He watched the games from afar. (24) He saw the missiles and the weapons being flung and he saw Baldur stand smiling and happy under the strokes of metal and stones and great woods. (25) He wondered at the sight, but he knew that he might not ask the meaning of it from the ones who knew him. (26) He changed his shape into that of an old woman and he went amongst those who were making sport for Baldur. (27) He spoke to Dwarfs and friendly Giants. (28) \"Go to Frigga and ask. (29) Go to Frigga and ask,\" was all the answer Loki got from any of them. (30) Then to Fensalir, Frigga's mansion, Loki went.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Where did Loki go to see Frigga?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"26\": \"Sentence 26\",\n                \"27\": \"Sentence 27\",\n                \"28\": \"Sentence 28\",\n                \"29\": \"Sentence 29\",\n                \"30\": \"Sentence 30\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"30\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 30 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly mentions that Loki went to \\\"Fensalir, Frigga\\\"s mansion.\\\" This is the only sentence that specifies where Loki went to find Frigga.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who is being addressed as Odin?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Sentence 1\",\n                \"2\": \"Sentence 2\",\n                \"3\": \"Sentence 3\",\n                \"4\": \"Sentence 4\",\n                \"5\": \"Sentence 5\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"1\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 1 is the correct answer to the question because it directly states \\\"Thou art Odin,\\\" indicating that the speaker is addressing someone as Odin.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"Who watched the games from afar?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"21\": \"Sentence 21\",\n                \"22\": \"Sentence 22\",\n                \"23\": \"Sentence 23\",\n                \"24\": \"Sentence 24\",\n                \"25\": \"Sentence 25\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"23\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 23 explicitly states that \\\"He watched the games from afar,\\\" clearly identifying Loki as the one observing the games from a distance.

(2) “What a dreadful storm it was! (3) The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand. (4) However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the door. (5) “‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window. (6) “‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him. (7) “But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse. (8) At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned. (9) His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage. (10) “Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner. (11) “‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I should have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief. (12) “‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes. (13) “‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do with it. (14) It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it. (15) I will certainly take care not to give away anything again. (16) One always suffers for being generous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause. (17) “Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet. (18) “But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat. (19) “Oh! (20) I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I don’t care.”\n\n\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said the Water-rat. (21) “I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the Linnet. (22) “The what?” screamed the Water-rat. (23) “The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet. (24) “Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you should have told me that before you began. (25) If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said ‘Pooh,’ like the critic. (26) However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out “Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole. (27) “And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards. (28) “He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet. (29) “The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n\n\n“Ah!\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who expressed fear of annoying someone?\",\n

(2) Bang! (3) answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely. (4) Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket. (5) He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all. (6) The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use. (7) All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire. (8) Huzza! (9) Huzza! (10) cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure. (11) “I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the Rocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious than ever. (12) The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy. (13) “This is evidently a deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming dignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject. (14) But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away. (15) Then one of them caught sight of him. (16) “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he threw him over the wall into the ditch. (17) “Rocket?Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air; “impossible!Rocket, that is what the man said.andsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell into the mud. (18) “It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health. (19) My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.”\n\n\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him. (20) “A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog. (21) “Well, after all there is nothing like mud. (22) Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy. (23) Do you think it will be a wet afternoon? (24) I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless. (25) What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! (26) ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.

(2) Your letter has frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.”\n\n\n\n“Julie,” said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, “go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.”\n\n\n\nThe young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand. (3) “Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?” inquired the man, with a strong Italian accent. (4) “Yes, sir,” replied Julie with hesitation; “what is your pleasure? (5) I do not know you.”\n\n“Read this letter,” he said, handing it to her. (6) Julie hesitated. (7) “It concerns the best interests of your father,” said the messenger. (8) The young girl hastily took the letter from him. (9) She opened it quickly and read:\n\n“Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan, enter the house No. (10) 15, ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father. (11) It is important that he should receive it before eleven o’clock. (12) You promised to obey me implicitly. (13) Remember your oath. (14) “Sinbad the Sailor.”\n\nThe young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to question the messenger, but he had disappeared. (15) She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a postscript. (16) She read:\n\n“It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone. (17) If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else go in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it.”\n\n\n\nThis postscript decreased greatly the young girl’s happiness. (18) Was there nothing to fear? (19) was there not some snare laid for her? (20) Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age. (21) But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it; indeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror. (22) Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. (23) Yet, through a singular impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied, but to Emmanuel. (24) She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her father’s, related the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and showed him the letter. (25) “You must go, then, mademoiselle,” said Emmanuel. (26) “Go there?” murmured Julie. (27) “Yes; I will accompany you.”\n\n“But did you not read that I must be alone?” said Julie. (28) “And you shall be alone,” replied the young man. (29) “I will await you at the corner of the Rue du Musée, and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me!”\n\n\n\n“Then, Emmanuel?” said the young girl with hesitation, “it is your opinion that I should obey this invitation?”\n\n\n\n“Yes.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077oc3pxw0738y749vr2v", "global_key": "70169_7_6", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: The Happy Prince, and Other Tales\n\nBook Author: Oscar Wilde\n\nParagraph: (1) He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. (2) “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up. (3) “I am going to Egypt”! (4) cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. (5) “I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried. (6) “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?”\n\n\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here. (7) In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. (8) My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. (9) Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. (10) The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.”\n\n\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl. (11) She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. (12) Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. (13) She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. (14) Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.”\n\n\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye. (15) You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”\n\n\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it. (16) He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. (17) “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing. (18) Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. (19) “You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with you always.”\n\n\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet. (20) All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. (21) He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies. (22) “Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. (23) There is no Mystery so great as Misery. (24) Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\n\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. (25) He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. (26) Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. (27) “How hungry we are!” they said. (28) “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain. (29) Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen. (30) “I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.”\n\n\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did the Watchman say to the

(2) For meat the Champions ate the flesh of the boar Sæhrimnir; every day the boar was killed and cooked, and every morning it was whole again. (3) For drink they had the mead that was made from the milk of the goat Heidrun, the goat that browsed on the leaves of the tree Læradir. (4) And the Valkyries, the wise and fearless battle-maidens, went amongst them, filling up the drinking-horns with the heady mead. (5) Youngest of all the battle-maidens was Brynhild. (6) Nevertheless, to her Odin All-Father had shown more of the Runes of Wisdom than he had shown to any of her sisters. (7) And when the time came for Brynhild to journey down into Midgard he gave her a swan-feather dress such as he had given before to the three Valkyrie sisters—Alvit, Olrun, and Hladgrun. (8) In the dazzling plumage of a swan the young battle-maiden flew down from Asgard. (9) Not yet had she to go to the battlefields. (10) Waters drew her, and as she waited onthe will of the All-Father she sought out a lake that had golden sands for its shore, and as a maiden bathed in it. (11) Now there dwelt near this lake a young hero whose name was Agnar. (12) And one day as Agnar lay by the lake he saw a swan with dazzling plumage fly down to it. (13) And while she was in the reeds the swan-feather dress slipped off her, and Agnar beheld the swan change to a maiden. (14) So bright was her hair, so strong and swift were all her movements, that he knew her for one of Odin's battle-maidens; for one of those who give victory and choose the slain. (15) Very daring was Agnar, and he set his mind upon capturing this battle-maiden even though he should bring on himself the wrath of Odin by doing it. (16) He hid the swan-feather dress that she had left in the reeds. (17) When she came out of the water she might not fly away. (18) Agnar gave back to her the swan-feather dress, but she had to promise that she would be his battle-maiden. (19) And as they talked together the young Valkyrie saw in him a hero that one from Asgard might help. (20) Very brave and very noble was Agnar. (21) Brynhild went with him as his battle-maiden, and she told him much from the Runes of Wisdom that she knew, and she showed him that the All-Father's last hope was in the bravery of the heroes of the earth; with the Chosen from the Slain for his Champions he would make battle in defence of Asgard. (22) Always Brynhild was with Agnar's battalions; above the battles she hovered, her bright hair and flashing battle-dress outshining the spears and swords and shields of the warriors. (23) But the gray-beard King Helmgunnar made war onthe young Agnar. (24) Odin favored the gray-beard King, and to him he promised the victory. (25) Brynhild knew the will of the All-Father. (26) But to Agnar, not to Helmgunnar, she gave the victory. (27) Doomed was Brynhild on the instant she went against Odin's will. (28) Never again might she come into Asgard.

Nesbit\n\nParagraph: (1) \"WhenImarry,\" said Gerald, \"I'll marry a dumb girl, or else get the ring to make her sothat she can't speak unless she's spoken to. (2) Let's have a squint.\". (3) He applied his eye to the stone lattice. (4) \"They're moving off,\" he said. (5) \"Those pink and purple hats are nodding off in the distant prospect; and the funny little man with the beard like a goat is going a different way from every one else—the gardeners will have to head him off. (6) I don't see Mademoiselle, though. (7) The rest of you had better bunk. (8) It doesn't do to run any risks with picnics. (9) The deserted hero of our tale, alone and unsupported, urged on his brave followers to pursue the commissariat waggons, he himself remaining at the post of danger and difficulty, because he was born to stand on burning decks whence all but he had fled, and to lead forlorn hopes when despaired of by the human race!\". (10) \"I think I'll marry a dumb husband,\" said Mabel, \"and there shan't be any heroes in my books when I write them, only a heroine. (11) Come on, Cathy.\". (12) Coming out of that cool, shadowy summer-house into the sunshine was like stepping into an oven, and the stone of the terrace was burning to the children's feet. (13) \"I know now what a cat on hot bricks feels like,\" said Jimmy. (14) The antediluvian animals are set in a beech-wood on a slope at least half a mile across the park from the castle. (15) The grandfather of the present Lord Yalding had them set there in the middle of last century, in the great days of thelate Prince Consort, the Exhibition of 1851, Sir Joseph Paxton, and the Crystal Palace. (16) Their stone flanks, their wide, ungainly wings, their lozenged crocodile-like backs show grey through the trees a long way off. (17) Most people think that noon is the hottest time of the day. (18) They are wrong. (19) A cloudless sky gets hotter and hotter all the afternoon, and reaches its very hottest at five. (20) I am sure you must all have noticed this when you are going out to tea anywhere in your best clothes, especially if your clothes are starched and you happen to have a rather long and shadeless walk. (21) Kathleen, Mabel, and Jimmy got hotter and hotter, and went more and more slowly. (22) They had almost reached that stage of resentment and discomfort when one \"wishes one hadn't come\" before they saw, below the edge of the beech-wood, the white waved handkerchief of the bailiff. (23) That banner, eloquent of tea, shade, and being able to sit down, put new heart into them. (24) They mended their pace, and a final desperate run landed them among the drifted coppery leaves and bare grey and green roots of the beech-wood. (25) \"Oh, glory!\". (26) said Jimmy, throwing himself down. (27) \"How do you do?\". (28) The bailiff looked very nice, the girls thought. (29) He was not wearing his velveteens, but a grey flannel suit that an Earl need not have scorned; and his straw hat would have done no discreditto a Duke; and a Prince could not have worn a prettier green tie.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What was the bailiff wearing?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"25\": \"Sentence

Nesbit\n\nParagraph: (1) \"Our hero,\" said Gerald, \"who nothing could dismay, raised the faltering hopes of his abject minions by saying that he was jolly well going on, and they could do as they liked about it.\". (2) \"If you call names,\" said Jimmy, \"you can go on by yourself.\". (3) He added, \"So there!\". (4) \"It's part of the game, silly,\" explained Gerald kindly. (5) \"You can be Captain to-morrow, so you'd better hold your jaw now, and begin tothink about what names you'll call us when it's your turn.\". (6) Very slowly and carefully they went down the steps. (7) A vaulted stone arched over their heads. (8) Gerald struck a match when the last step was found to have no edge, and to be, in fact, the beginning of a passage, turning to the left. (9) \"This,\" said Jimmy, \"will take us back into the road.\". (10) \"Or under it,\" said Gerald. (11) \"We've come down eleven steps.\". (12) They went on, following their leader, who went very slowly for fear, as he explained, of steps. (13) The passage was very dark. (14) \"I don't half like it!\". (15) whispered Jimmy. (16) Then came a glimmer of daylight that grew and grew, and presently ended in another arch that looked out over a scene so like a picture out of a book about Italy that every one's breath was taken away, and they simply walked forward silent and staring. (17) A short avenue of cypresses led, widening as it went, to a marble terrace that lay broad and white in the sunlight. (18) The children, blinking, leaned their arms on the broad, flat balustrade and gazed. (19) Immediately below them was a lake—just like a lake in \"The Beauties of Italy\"—a lake with swans and an island and weeping willows; beyond it were green slopes dotted with groves of trees, and amid the trees gleamed the white limbs of statues. (20) Against a little hill to the left was a round white building with pillars, and to the right a waterfall cametumbling down among mossy stones to splash into the lake. (21) Steps led from the terrace to the water, and other steps to the green lawns beside it. (22) Away across the grassy slopes deer were feeding, and in the distance where the groves of trees thickened into what looked almost a forest were enormous shapes of grey stone, like nothing that the children had ever seen before. (23) \"That chap at school——\" said Gerald. (24) \"Itisan enchanted castle,\" said Kathleen. (25) \"I don't see any castle,\" said Jimmy. (26) \"What do you call that, then?\". (27) Gerald pointed to where, beyond a belt of lime-trees, white towers and turrets broke the blue of the sky. (28) \"There doesn't seem to be any one about,\" said Kathleen, \"and yet it's all so tidy. (29) I believe it is magic.\". (30) \"Magic mowing machines,\" Jimmy suggested.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Gerald point out?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n

(2) “Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\n\n\n\n“Oh, Lord! (3) I don’t know. (4) Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\n\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\n\n\n\n“As often as I can. (5) But you know married women have never much time for writing. (6) My sisters may write tome. (7) They will have nothing else to do.”\n\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. (8) He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things. (9) “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, “as ever I saw. (10) He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. (11) I am prodigiously proud of him. (12) I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\n\n\n\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days. (13) “I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s friends. (14) One seems so forlorn without them.”\n\n“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth. (15) “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.”\n\n\n\n“It is no such thing. (16) Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. (17) If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\n\n\n\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. (18) The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. (19) Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. (20) She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head, by turns. (21) “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news). (22) “Well, so much the better. (23) Not that I care about it, though. (24) He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. (25) But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. (26) And who knows whatmayhappen? (27) But that is nothing to us. (28) You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. (29) And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\n\n“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. (30) He comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who confirmed the visitor\\\"s arrival?\",\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077p53py10738584htzwv", "global_key": "0ea75_7_32", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Pride and Prejudice\n\nBook Author: Jane Austen\n\nParagraph: (1) “Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away: it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. (2) Good gracious! (3) when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! (4) though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\n\n\n\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,—\n\n\n\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? (5) I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that hemight see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”\n\n\n\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. (6) She got up and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour. (7) She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,—\n\n\n\n“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.”\n\n\n\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. (8) Her ease and good spirits increased. (9) She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. (10) Wickham” by each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. (11) “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? (12) Is not he a charming man? (13) I am sure my sisters must all envy me. (14) I only hope they may have half my good luck. (15) They must all go to Brighton. (16) That is the place to get husbands. (17) What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\n\n“Very true; and if I had my will we should. (18) But, my dear Lydia, I don’t at all like your going such a way off. (19) Must it be so?”\n\n“Oh, Lord! (20) yes; there is nothing in that. (21) I shall like it of all things. (22) You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. (23) We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”\n\n\n\n“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother. (24) “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.”\n\n\n\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n\n\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. (25) Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. (26) No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. (27) These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not. (28) Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. (29) She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. (30) Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who made the most of the time by visiting and having parties?\",\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077pa3py2073896y0cpnm", "global_key": "17f0e_7_27", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Raggedy Ann Stories\n\nBook Author: Johnny Gruelle\n\nParagraph: (1) As they pulled and tugged and flopped Raggedy Ann about, somehow she fell over the side of the bridge into the water. (2) The puppy dogs were surprised, and Fido was very sorry indeed, for he remembered how good Raggedy Ann had been to him and how she had rescued him from the dog-pound. (3) But the current carried Raggedy Ann right along and all Fido could do was to run along the bank and bark. (4) Now, you would have thought Raggedy Ann would sink, but no, she floated nicely, for she was stuffed with clean white cotton and the water didn't soak through very quickly. (5) After a while, the strange puppy and Fido grew tired of running along the bank and the strange puppy scampered home over the meadow, with his tail carried gaily over his back as if he had nothing to be ashamed of. (6) But Fido walked home very sorry indeed. (7) His little heart was broken to think that he had caused Raggedy Ann to be drowned. (8) But Raggedy Ann didn't drown—not a bit of it. (9) In fact, she even went to sleep on the brook, for the motion of the current was very soothing as it carried her along—just like being rocked by Marcella. (10) So, sleeping peacefully, Raggedy Ann drifted along with the current until she came to a pool where she lodged against a large stone. (11) Raggedy Ann tried to climb upon the stone, but by this time the water had thoroughly soaked through Raggedy Ann's nice, clean, white cotton stuffing and she was so heavy she could not climb. (12) So there she had to stay until Marcella and Daddy came along and found her. (13) You see, they had been looking for her. (14) They had found pieces of her apron all along the path and across the meadow where Fido and the strange puppy dog had shaken them from Raggedy Ann. (15) So they followed the brook until they found her. (16) When Daddy fished Raggedy Ann from the water, Marcella hugged her so tightly to her breast the water ran from Raggedy Ann and dripped all over Marcella's apron. (17) But Marcella was so glad to find Raggedy Ann again she didn't mind it a bit. (18) She just hurried home and took off all of Raggedy Ann's wet clothes and placed her on a little red chair in front of the oven door, and then brought all of the other dolls in and read a fairy tale to them while Raggedy Ann steamed and dried. (19) When Raggedy Ann was thoroughly dry, Mamma said she thought the cake must be finished and she took from the oven a lovely chocolate cake and gave Marcella a large piece to have another tea party with. (20) That night when all the house was asleep, Raggedy Ann raised up in bed and said to the dolls who were still awake, \"I am so happy I do not feel a bit sleepy. (21) Do you know, I believe the water soaked me so thoroughly my candy heart must have melted and filled my whole body, and I do not feel the least bit angry with Fido for playing with me so roughly!\". (22) So all the other dolls were happy, too, for happiness is very easy to catch when we love one another and are sweet all through.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

(2) “‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always thinking of others. (3) And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.’\n\n\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm. (4) “‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller. (5) “‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear. (6) “‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller. (7) “‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed. (8) I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and wondered how you were getting on.’\n\n\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten me.’\n\n\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never forgets. (9) That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t understand the poetry of life. (10) How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!”\n\n\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many. (11) I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow? (12) You don’t mean to say you have sold it? (13) What a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to. (14) You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. (15) So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. (16) But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow. (17) It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. (18) I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. (19) I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself. (20) Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. (21) ‘I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. (22) There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don’t stop it up. (23) How lucky you mentioned it! (24) It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another. (25) I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. (26) Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that. (27) Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out. (28) “‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. (29) And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What

(2) “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”\n\n\n\n“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were.Wewere always good friends, and now we are better.”\n\n\n\n“True. (3) Are the others coming out?”\n\n“I do not know. (4) Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. (5) And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.”\n\n\n\nShe replied in the affirmative. (6) “I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. (7) And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? (8) Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. (9) But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, she did.”\n\n\n\n“And what did she say?”\n\n\n\n“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. (10) At such a distance asthat, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.”\n\n\n\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. (11) Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,—\n\n\n\n“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. (12) We passed each other several times. (13) I wonder what he can be doing there.”\n\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth. (14) “It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year.”\n\n\n\n“Undoubtedly. (15) Did you see him while you were at Lambton? (16) I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”\n\n\n\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\n\n\n\n“And do you like her?”\n\n\n\n“Very much.”\n\n\n\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. (17) When I last saw her, she was not very promising. (18) I am very glad you liked her. (19) I hope she will turn out well.”\n\n“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\n\n\n\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\n\n\n\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\n\n\n\n“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. (20) A most delightful place! (21) Excellent parsonage-house! (22) It would have suited me in every respect.”\n\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n\n\n\n“Exceedingly well. (23) I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. (24) One ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! (25) The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! (26) But it was not to be. (27) Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent?”\n\n\n\n“Ihaveheard from authority, which I thoughtas good,that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\n\n\n\n“You have! (28) Yes, there was something inthat; I told you so from the first, you may remember.”\n\n\n\n“Ididhear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.”\n\n\n\n“You did!

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r077pq3py50738tvv8tajv", "global_key": "98672_7_5", "row_data": "Grade level: 7 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: The Happy Prince, and Other Tales\n\nBook Author: Oscar Wilde\n\nParagraph: (1) morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. (2) He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber. (3) The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water. (4) “You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done. (5) But the little ducks paid no attention to her. (6) They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. (7) “What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really deserve to be drowned.”\n\n\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n\n\n“Ah! (8) I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat; “I am not a family man. (9) In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be. (10) Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher. (11) Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation. (12) “Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example. (13) “What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat. (14) “I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings. (15) “I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat. (16) “Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet. (17) “Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat. (18) “If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.

(2) She was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in. (3) She is a woman that one may, that onemustlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. (4) It was better to pay my visit, then”—\n\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window. (5) “In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion”—\n\n\n\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. (6) She hardly knew what to say. (7) It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she did not wish. (8) Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n\n\n\n“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then”—\n\n\n\nHe was silent. (9) She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. (10) She heard him sigh. (11) It was natural for him to feel that he hadcauseto sigh. (12) He could not believe her to be encouraging him. (13) A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\n\n\n\n“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. (14) My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—\n\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed. (15) He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? (16) Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed. (17) A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. (18) Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave. (19) “I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. (20) I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. (21) I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. (22) She has been so kind as to promise it. (23) Oh! (24) the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent! (25) she will tell me every thing. (26) In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.”\n\n\n\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. (27) Short had been the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much. (28) It was a sad change. (29) They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival. (30) Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners! (31) It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days. (32) To complete every other recommendation, he hadalmosttold her that he loved her.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What was the emotional impact of
