Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) ""I went on a great ride with the doctor,"" Pollyanna said as she jumped up the steps. (2) ""He's so nice, Nancy!"". (3) ""Really?"". (4) Nancy asked. (5) ""Yes. (6) I told him his job must make him very happy,"" Pollyanna replied.

 (7) ""Why? (8) He visits sick people and some who just think they are sick. (9) That seems tough,"" said Nancy, looking confused. (10) Pollyanna giggled. (11) ""That's what he thought too. (12) But there's a way to be happy even then. (13) Can you guess?"". (14) Nancy thought hard. (15) She was getting good at this ""being glad"" game that Pollyanna loved.

 (16) ""I've got it!"". (17) Nancy smiled. (18) ""It's the opposite of what you told Mrs. (19) Snow."". (20) ""Opposite?"". (21) Pollyanna looked puzzled. (22) ""You told Mrs. (23) Snow to be happy because she wasn't like others who were sick,"" Nancy explained.

 (24) ""Yes,"" Pollyanna nodded.

 (25) ""So, the doctor can be happy because he's not like the sick people he helps,"" Nancy said proudly.

 (26) Pollyanna looked a bit unsure.

 (27) ""Well, yes, that's one way to look at it. (28) But it's not exactly what I meant. (29) It sounds a bit strange, like he's happy they are sick. (30) Sometimes your way of playing the game is funny, Nancy,"" Pollyanna said, a little confused as she went inside.

 (31) Pollyanna saw her aunt in the living room.

 (32) ""Who was that man in the yard, Pollyanna?"". (33) her aunt asked, sounding a bit stern. (34) ""That was Dr. Chilton! (35) Don't you know him, Aunt Polly?"". (36) Pollyanna replied with surprise. (37) ""Dr. Chilton! (38) What was he doing here?"". (39) her aunt asked again. (40) ""He drove me home. (41) Oh, and I gave the jelly to Mr. Pendleton, and—"" Pollyanna continued, eager to share her adventures.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) ""Hello there, girls!"". (2) said Huldah Meserve, popping her head in through the door. (3) ""Can you take a break and show me around your room? (4) I just got these new gloves from the store. (5) I didn't want to wear mittens this winter; they feel too old-fashioned. (6) Since it's your first year here and you're younger than me, you might not think about these things, but I like to look stylish. (7) Wow, your room is so pretty! (8) I think it's the nicest one here! (9) Is it the curtains, or that lovely screen, or maybe Rebecca's lamp that makes it look so special? (10) You guys are really good at decorating. (11) I like my room to be pretty too, but I'm always so busy I hardly have time to tidy it up. (12) I usually don't make my bed until noon! (13) But since only our friends come over, it doesn't really matter much. (14) When I finish school, I'm going to decorate our living room at home and make it look amazing. (15) I've started learning some crafty decorating, and I'm going to add lots of cool things once I learn more.

 (16) Can I warm my feet by your heater? (17) I don't like wearing boots that cover my feet completely unless it's really muddy. (18) They make your feet look so big. (19) I had a hard time finding these boots with little heels, and I don't want to ruin them by wearing them in mud too often. (20) I think boys notice shoes a lot. (21) Yesterday, Elmer Webster stepped on my foot by accident and said sorry later. (22) He joked that my foot was so small he didn't even see it! (23) Isn't that funny? (24) Well, I do wear small shoes, and these heels make them look even smaller. (25) They say having a high arch is pretty, and even though I used to worry about mine, now I think it's nice. (26) Let's compare our feet, just for fun!"". (27) Huldah loved talking and sharing with her friends. (28) She always had something interesting or funny to say about her clothes and shoes.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) ""Let me tell you a story,"" Nancy said. (2) ""It's about a game Pollyanna's dad taught her. (3) One time, Pollyanna got crutches instead of a doll. (4) She was sad at first because she wanted a doll."".

 (5) ""But then, her dad told her something special. (6) He said that you can find something to be happy about in everything. (7) Even with the crutches, Pollyanna found something to be glad about."".

 (8) ""Be glad for crutches?"". (9) Miss Polly couldn't believe it. (10) She thought of the little legs that couldn't walk upstairs.

 (11) ""Yes,"" Nancy continued. (12) ""Pollyanna's dad said she could be happy because she didn't need to use them."".

 (13) Miss Polly just said, ""Oh!"".

 (14) Nancy smiled and said, ""Pollyanna made it a game. (15) She tried to find something happy in everything. (16) Even without the doll, she was happy she didn't need the crutches."".

 (17) ""They called it the 'Being Glad Game.' (18) Pollyanna has played it ever since."". (19) Miss Polly was puzzled. (20) ""But how does it work?"". (21) Nancy explained, ""It's amazing how well it works. (22) Pollyanna has helped so many people feel better. (23) She even made me feel happy about little and big things."".

 (24) ""For example,"" Nancy laughed, ""I used to not like my name, 'Nancy.' (25) But Pollyanna told me to be glad it wasn't 'Hephzibah.' (26) It made me feel better."". (27) ""And you know what? (28) I used to not like Mondays. (29) But Pollyanna has made me look forward to them."".

 (30) ""She finds happiness in everything, and it makes everything easier. (31) "".

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) Nancy had to go tell Mr. John Pendleton some important news from Dr. Mead. (2) Miss Polly had promised Mr. Pendleton he'd hear news directly from them. (3) So, Miss Polly asked Nancy to go because she couldn't go herself.

 (4) Nancy used to dream about visiting the big old house where Mr. Pendleton lived. (5) It was full of secrets and known as the House of Mystery. (6) But today, Nancy was too sad to be excited. (7) When Mr. Pendleton saw Nancy, he looked very surprised. (8) He didn't expect her to visit him. (9) ""I'm Nancy, sir,"" she said politely. (10) ""Miss Harrington sent me to tell you about Miss Pollyanna."".

 (11) ""Well?"". (12) Mr. Pendleton asked quickly. (13) He sounded a bit sharp, but Nancy knew he was really worried.

 (14) ""It ain't well, Mr. Pendleton,"" Nancy answered, her voice shaky.

 (15) ""You don't mean—"" Mr. Pendleton couldn't finish his question. (16) He looked very scared. (17) ""Yes, sir,"" Nancy nodded sadly. (18) ""She can't walk again. (19) Never."". (20) The room was very quiet for a little while. (21) Then Mr. Pendleton spoke, and his voice was full of sadness.

 (22) ""Poor little girl! (23) Poor little girl!"". (24) Nancy looked at him. (25) She was surprised. (26) Mr. Pendleton usually seemed grumpy, but now he looked very sad.

 (27) ""It seems so cruel,"" Mr. Pendleton said quietly. (28) ""She'll never dance in the sunshine again. (29) My little prism girl!"". (30) They were quiet again. (31) Then Mr. Pendleton suddenly asked, ""She doesn't know yet, right?"".

 (32) ""But she does, sir,"" Nancy replied, starting to cry. (33) ""And that's what makes it even harder. (34) She found out by accident."". (35) Mr. Pendleton was shocked. (36) ""How did she find out?"". (37) he asked gently. (38) Nancy wiped her tears. (39) ""The cat, sir. (40) It pushed the door open, and Miss Pollyanna overheard them talking. (41) She learned about it that way."". (42) Mr. Pendleton looked very sad as Nancy told him everything. (43) It was a hard day for both of them.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) One day, Emma Jane and Rebecca were talking about something called a mortgage. (2) Emma was surprised to hear a mortgage could have a 'face.'

 (3) Rebecca said, ""Our mortgage does have a face. (4) If I saw him in the dark, I'd know him!"". (5) ""I'll draw him for you,"" Rebecca added. (6) ""It's good for you to see how he looks."". (7) Rebecca started drawing. (8) She drew a tiny house and a sad family in front of it. (9) The mortgage looked scary, like a mix of a monster and a giant, holding up an axe.

 (10) In her drawing, Rebecca drew herself stopping the scary mortgage from hurting the family.

 (11) ""He looks so scary but also tiny,"" Emma Jane said.

 (12) Rebecca explained, ""It's a small mortgage, only twelve hundred dollars. (13) I heard about bigger ones!"". (14) Then, Emma Jane asked, ""Do you want to be a writer when you grow up?"".

 (15) Rebecca answered, ""I might, but I'm not sure yet. (16) I'll do whatever comes my way."". (17) Emma Jane suggested, ""Why not be a missionary in Syria? (18) They'll even pay for your trip."". (19) Rebecca wasn't sure. (20) ""I don't think I'm ready to be a missionary. (21) I want to help people, but I'm still learning about life myself."".

 (22) Emma Jane wondered how people far away would learn about important things without help.

 (23) Rebecca thought for a moment and said, ""I believe God is everywhere, helping everyone find their way, even if it takes time. (24) Even people in hot countries with no books will find Him eventually."".

 (25) Rebecca and Emma Jane both thought about how big the world is and how many different people are in it. (26) They knew they had a lot to learn, but talking together was a good start.

Paragraph: (1) Lydgate was feeling really upset. (2) This was not the first time he felt this way because of her. (3) She wouldn't look at him or say anything. (4) ""I was thinking about going to Quallingham,"" Lydgate said sadly. (5) ""It would have been hard, but maybe it would have helped. (6) But it seems like nothing I think of works. (7) You seem to say yes, but then you don't really agree. (8) If you don't want to do what I wish, just tell me. (9) Then I'll know what's going on."". (10) Rosamond was very quiet. (11) A tear rolled down her cheek. (12) She was really unhappy with Lydgate. (13) She felt that everyone was being mean, even her father. (14) She thought everyone only cared about themselves.

 (15) Lydgate looked at her and felt very helpless. (16) He hated feeling this way. (17) It made him question if he was right or wrong. (18) ""Rosamond,"" he tried again, ""we need to be open and trust each other. (19) You often agree with me, but then you do something else. (20) I never know what to expect. (21) We could fix things if you admit this. (22) Am I really so bad? (23) Why can't you be honest with me?"". (24) She stayed quiet. (25) Lydgate kept trying.

Book Title: Raggedy Ann Stories

Book Author: Johnny Gruelle

Paragraph: (1) Raggedy Ann was a doll with a big, bright smile. (2) One day, a playful puppy named Fido saw her smiling. (3) Fido thought Raggedy Ann wanted to play. (4) So, he started doing funny tricks to make her laugh.

 (5) As Fido played, he grabbed the end of Raggedy Ann's dress. (6) He tugged and pulled her around. (7) It looked like a game, but Raggedy Ann wasn't having fun. (8) She tried to get away, but Fido thought she was playing along. 

(9) Fido took Raggedy Ann out of the garden. (10) They went down a path and across a meadow. (11) Sometimes, Fido stopped and shook Raggedy Ann. (12) Her head would hit the ground with a ""ratty-tat-tat"" sound. (13) Then Fido would toss her into the air. (14) Raggedy Ann would flip over a few times before landing.

 (15) During their game, Raggedy Ann lost her apron. (16) Some of her yarn hair started to come loose too. (17) Soon, they came near a brook. (18) Another puppy saw them and ran over the foot-bridge to greet them. (19) ""What have you there, Fido?"". (20) asked the new puppy. (21) ""This is Raggedy Ann,"" Fido replied. (22) ""We are having fun playing."". (23) The new puppy didn't know Raggedy Ann wasn't really having fun. (24) Fido really believed she liked being tossed and turned.

 (25) But the wild game did not last much longer. (26) When Raggedy Ann landed on the ground again, the new puppy grabbed her dress. (27) He ran across the bridge, with Fido barking and following right behind him.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) Mrs. Farebrother was a kind lady who liked things just right. (2) She told her guest that they hardly ever got sick in her house. (3) She believed that because she taught her kids to dress warmly and not eat too much, they stayed healthy. (4) Eating too much, she said, was why people often needed doctors.

 (5) Dr. Lydgate, the guest, talked about kids who had parents who ate too much. (6) But Mrs. Farebrother thought it was simple - if you do wrong, it's because of you, not your parents.

 (7) ""My mother doesn't like confusing ideas,"" said the Vicar, her son.

 (8) ""I like simple truths,"" Mrs. Farebrother said. (9) ""When I was young, we knew what was right and wrong just from our lessons at church."".

 (10) ""Nowadays,"" she continued, ""even if you quote the Prayer-book, someone might disagree!"".

 (11) ""That must make discussions interesting for those who like to argue,"" Dr. Lydgate commented.

 (12) ""But my mother usually agrees in the end,"" the Vicar added with a wink.

 (13) ""No, Camden, that's not right,"" Mrs. Farebrother corrected. (14) ""I stick to what my parents taught me. (15) Changing your mind too much isn't good."". (16) Dr. Lydgate smiled. (17) ""Maybe someone might find a reason to change once."".

 (18) ""But if you start changing for every new argument, where does it end?"". (19) she replied. (20) ""My father was consistent and a good man without needing fancy arguments."".

 (21) ""If arguments made good people, then reading a cookbook should make a good dinner,"" she joked.

 (22) ""True, especially about dinner,"" her son agreed.

 (23) Mrs. Farebrother was firm in her beliefs. (24) She didn't care for new ideas which, to her, were like poorly made clothes that wouldn't last.

 (25) ""In my days, you knew a churchman was respectable,"" she said. (26) ""Now, it's hard to tell. (27) They might even try to replace my son unfairly."".

 (28) ""But no matter what,"" she boasted proudly, ""my son is as good a preacher as any, and I stand by that. (29) "".

Book Title: Raggedy Ann Stories

Book Author: Johnny Gruelle

Paragraph: (1) Marcella loved playing with her dolls. (2) She played with Raggedy Ann so much that her right hand almost wore out!

 (3) One day, the French doll wanted to have some fun. (4) ""Let's play lively music!"". (5) she giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. (6) So, Uncle Clem, a strong doll, started playing the toy piano. (7) He hit the keys hard and made a lot of noise. (8) Suddenly, they heard footsteps on the stairs. (9) All the dolls quickly sat still. (10) They didn't want real people to see them moving. (11) But it was just Fido, Marcella's dog. (12) He peeked into the room through the door. (13) The dolls didn't move. (14) They stared at the fake food on their table. (15) Uncle Clem stopped playing the piano and pretended to be a regular doll again.

 (16) Fido pushed the door open wider and wagged his tail as he came in.

 (17) He sniffed around the table. (18) He hoped Marcella might have left some real snacks for the dolls.

 (19) Fido looked around and asked, ""Where's Raggedy Ann?"".

 (20) The dolls all said together, ""Mistress took Raggedy Ann with her!"".

 (21) Fido seemed a bit sad. (22) He had found something exciting and wanted to tell Raggedy Ann.

 (23) ""I have to tell Raggedy Ann something important!"". (24) Fido barked, scratching his ear. (25) He waited in the nursery, hoping Raggedy Ann would come back soon.

Book Title: Raggedy Ann Stories

Book Author: Johnny Gruelle

Paragraph: (1) ""Marcella felt sad because they forgot Freddy,"" she said.

 (2) Her new friend nodded. (3) ""That's true,"" he replied as he picked up Raggedy Ann. (4) He made Raggedy Ann dance on Marcella's knee. (5) ""But guess what happened to Freddy?"". (6) ""What happened?"". (7) Marcella asked, curious. (8) ""Well,"" her friend started, ""when Freddy was covered with sand, he actually liked it. (9) He didn't even mind when the water covered him. (10) He thought Virginia and Doris would come back to get him.

 (11) ""But then, something cool happened. (12) Freddy felt the sand on top of him move. (13) Someone was digging him out! (14) Soon, he could see the sky through the clear water."".

 (15) ""Who was digging him out?"". (16) Marcella wondered. (17) ""It was the Tide Fairies!"". (18) her friend exclaimed. (19) ""They found Freddy under the sand."". (20) ""Then what?"". (21) Marcella asked, eager to hear more. (22) ""The Tide Fairies took Freddy out into the deeper water. (23) There, they met the Undertow Fairies. (24) The Undertow Fairies passed Freddy to the Roller Fairies."".

 (25) ""Wow!"". (26) said Marcella. (27) ""The Roller Fairies brought Freddy up to the top of the water. (28) They tossed him to the Spray Fairies."". (29) ""And then?"". (30) Marcella couldn't wait to hear the rest. (31) ""The Spray Fairies were really fun. (32) They carried Freddy even higher and gave him to the Wind Fairies."".

 (33) ""The Wind Fairies?"". (34) Marcella asked, holding her breath. (35) ""Yes! (36) The Wind Fairies flew with Freddy. (37) They played with him in the air,"" her friend finished with a smile.

 (38) Marcella clapped her hands. (39) ""That sounds like such an adventure for Freddy!"".

 (40) ""Yes, it was!"". (41) her friend laughed. (42) ""Freddy had a wonderful time with all those fairies. (43) "".

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) ""He was happy with what he did. (2) He said, 'I knew you would like it. (3) When we have parties, we need a lot of people. (4) You can never have too many guests at a party! (5) And she's really nice, we couldn't leave her out.'""

 (6) Emma didn't say anything. (7) But she didn't agree with him either. (8) It was now June, and the weather was great. (9) Mrs. Elton couldn't wait to set a date for their big party. (10) She wanted to talk to Mr. Weston about the food, like pigeon pies and cold lamb. (11) But then, one of the carriage horses got hurt. (12) This meant they had to wait. (13) They didn't know how long. (14) It could be days or weeks! (15) They couldn't plan anything. (16) Mrs. Elton was very upset. (17) ""This is so annoying!"". (18) she said to Mr. Knightley. (19) ""It's perfect weather to go out. (20) We had such a fun trip last year at this time."". (21) Mr. Knightley had an idea. (22) ""Why don't you come to Donwell?"". (23) he said. (24) ""We don't need horses to go there. (25) You can come over and eat my strawberries. (26) They're almost ready."". (27) Mr. Knightley was half-joking at first, but then he saw how excited she got. (28) ""Oh, I'd love to!"". (29) she said. (30) Donwell was known for its strawberries. (31) That was why he invited her. (32) But he didn't really need a reason. (33) She just liked to go places. (34) She told him she would visit many times. (35) She was very happy he invited her. (36) ""You can count on me,"" she said. (37) ""Just tell me when, and I'll be there. (38) Can I bring Jane Fairfax too?"". (39) ""I can't set a day yet,"" he told her. (40) ""I need to talk to some other friends I want to invite."".

 (41) ""Don't worry about that,"" she said. (42) ""Let me handle it. (43) It's my party after all. (44) I'll bring some friends with me. (45) "".

Book Title: Raggedy Ann Stories

Book Author: Johnny Gruelle

Paragraph: (1) One day, the room where the toys lived needed a new look. (2) The mom decided it was time to paint the walls and change the wallpaper. (3) Because of this, all the toys had to be moved. (4) The dolls ended up on a high shelf in a big jumble.

 (5) That same day, the little girl who owned the dolls wanted to put them to bed. (6) But her mom said it was better to keep the beds in the closet. (7) The painters were coming back early the next day. (8) So the dolls' beds were stacked up in the closet, and the dolls stayed on the shelf.

 (9) When night came and the house was quiet, Raggedy Ann, a doll at the bottom of the pile, spoke softly. (10) She asked if the other dolls could move a little. (11) Raggedy Ann felt squished. (12) ""The cotton in my body is getting as flat as a pancake!"". (13) she said with a smile. (14) Even though a tin soldier's foot was pressing on her face, Raggedy Ann kept smiling. (15) Hearing her, the dolls began to shift around on the shelf. (16) Soon, Raggedy Ann had enough space to sit up. (17) ""Oh, that feels so much better!"". (18) Raggedy Ann exclaimed. (19) She stretched her arms and legs. (20) She even patted her dress to smooth it out. (21) All the dolls were happy to have a little more room on the shelf.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Harriet was going to sit for a picture again the next day. (2) Mr. Elton wanted to come and read to them while they did this.

 (3) ""Of course! (4) We would love for you to join us,"" they said to Mr. Elton.

 (5) The next day, everyone was polite and happy just like before. (6) The picture was coming along quickly and looked great. (7) Everyone liked it, but Mr. Elton loved it the most. (8) He thought it was perfect. (9) Mrs. Weston told Mr. Elton, ""Miss Woodhouse made her friend look beautiful. (10) But her eyebrows and eyelashes are different in real life."".

 (11) Mr. Elton didn't agree. (12) ""I think it looks just like her,"" he said. (13) ""We have to think about how the shadows change how she looks."".

 (14) Mr. Knightley had a different opinion. (15) ""Emma, you made her too tall,"" he said. (16) Emma didn't want to admit it, but Mr. Elton quickly said, ""No, she's not too tall. (17) She's sitting down, and that changes how tall she looks. (18) It's just right."". (19) Mr. Woodhouse looked at the picture and said, ""It's very pretty, Emma. (20) You always draw so well. (21) But it looks like she's sitting outside with just a shawl. (22) She might get cold."". (23) Emma explained, ""It's supposed to be a warm summer day. (24) See the tree?"". (25) ""But sitting outside can be risky,"" Mr. Woodhouse worried.

 (26) Mr. Elton then said, ""I think it's a great idea to show her outside. (27) The tree looks wonderful. (28) It fits her personality perfectly. (29) It’s a fantastic drawing. (30) I can't stop looking at it. (31) It looks just like her. (32) "".

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) One day, Will Ladislaw was walking down a hall with his friend, a German painter named Naumann. (2) They were talking about a woman Will had met only once before.

 (3) ""No, no,"" said Naumann, noticing Will looked a bit worried.

 (4) ""Do you know the woman?"". (5) Naumann asked. (6) ""Yes, she's married to my cousin,"" replied Will, looking a bit distracted.

 (7) ""She's your cousin's wife? (8) I thought he looked more like an uncle,"" Naumann joked.

 (9) ""He's not my uncle, he's my second cousin,"" Will corrected him, sounding a bit annoyed.

 (10) ""Okay, okay. (11) Don't be upset. (12) Do you mind if I think she looks like a perfect young Madonna?"". (13) Naumann asked. (14) ""I'm not mad. (15) I only saw her once, right before I left England,"" Will explained. (16) ""They weren't married then. (17) I didn't know they would be in Rome."". (18) ""But now you will visit them, right? (19) Find their address since you know the name,"" Naumann suggested.

 (20) ""I don't know what I'll do,"" Will said, unsure.

 (21) Naumann laughed, ""If you were an artist like me, you'd think of her as a beautiful subject for a painting."".

 (22) Will didn't agree. (23) ""I don't think the whole universe is about your paintings."".

 (24) Naumann put his hand on Will's shoulder, smiling. (25) ""My job is to paint. (26) And I think your cousin's wife would make a great picture!"".

 (27) ""What if I don't want you to paint her?"". (28) Will asked. (29) ""It doesn't matter. (30) It's all about creating art, whether it happens or not,"" Naumann explained.

 (31) Will laughed, despite his frustration.

 (32) ""So, will you help me meet her?"". (33) Naumann asked hopefully. (34) ""No, Naumann! (35) English ladies aren't just models for everyone. (36) And your paintings try to say too much,"" Will said firmly.

 (37) Naumann teased him, ""Yes, for those who can't paint, words are better."".

 (38) They continued their walk, chatting and laughing, even though they didn't agree on everything.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) June 17 - Today I cooked a turtle. (2) I found lots of eggs inside it. (3) It was the yummiest meat I've had since I came here. (4) I've only had chicken and goat meat before. (5) June 18 - It rained all day, so I stayed inside. (6) It was cold and I felt chilly, which was strange because it's usually warm here.

 (7) June 19 - I felt really sick today. (8) I was shivering as if it was very cold. (9) June 20 - I couldn't sleep last night. (10) My head hurt a lot and I felt hot. (11) June 21 - I was very sick and scared because I was alone. (12) For the first time since the big storm, I prayed to God. (13) My mind was all mixed up. (14) June 22 - I felt a little better, but I was still scared of being sick.

 (15) June 23 - I felt very sick again. (16) I was cold, then I shivered, and then my head hurt a lot.

 (17) June 24 - Today, I felt much better.

 (18) June 25 - I had a bad fever that lasted seven hours. (19) First, I was cold, then hot, and then I started sweating a little.

 (20) June 26 - I felt better, but I was very hungry. (21) I used my gun to hunt. (22) I was weak but I managed to catch a goat. (23) I cooked some meat by roasting it. (24) I wished I could make soup, but I didn't have a pot.

 (25) June 27 - I was very sick again, so I stayed in bed all day. (26) I couldn't eat or drink. (27) I was so thirsty, but too weak to get water. (28) I prayed to God. (29) I was confused and just kept saying, ""Lord, help me!"". (30) I fell asleep and woke up late at night feeling a little better but still very weak and thirsty. (31) I had no water, so I had to wait until morning. (32) June 28 - I slept again and had a scary dream. (33) I dreamed I was outside, and a man came down from the sky in a bright flame. (34) He looked scary and the ground shook when he landed. (35) He came towards me with a spear, wanting to hurt me. (36) He stood on a hill and said scary things to me. (37) He raised his spear as if to strike me.

(8) shouted the tin soldier. (9) ""Let's find something yummy to eat!"". (10) ""Yes, let's go eat!"". (11) all the other dolls cheered. (12) Raggedy Ann remembered something. (13) ""When I was playing outside this morning,"" she said, ""I smelled something really good near the back door!"".

 (14) ""Lead us there, Raggedy Ann!"". (15) said the French doll. (16) The Indian doll had an idea. (17) ""Let's make Raggedy Ann our leader for this adventure!"".

 (18) All the dolls clapped their hands and yelled, ""Yay! (19) Raggedy Ann will be our leader!"". (20) So, with Raggedy Ann leading the way, the dolls decided to go on a little adventure.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) One day, Friday told his master about his people and their battles.

 (2) Friday said, ""My nation fought really hard."".

 (3) His master asked, ""How did they fight?"".

 (4) Friday explained, ""There were more enemies where I was. (5) They captured me and a few others."". (6) ""But my people won the fight in another place. (7) They captured thousands of the enemy,"" added Friday.

 (8) The master was curious, ""Why didn't your people rescue you?"".

 (9) Friday replied, ""The enemies ran and took us away in a canoe. (10) We didn't have canoes to follow."". (11) The master then asked, ""What does your nation do with the people they capture?"".

 (12) Friday said sadly, ""They eat them."".

 (13) Shocked, the master asked, ""Where do they take them?"".

 (14) Friday answered, ""To a different place."".

 (15) ""Did they come here too?"". (16) the master wondered. (17) ""Yes, they came here too,"" Friday confirmed.

 (18) ""Have you been here before with them?"". (19) the master inquired. (20) ""Yes, I was here,"" Friday pointed to a part of the island.

 (21) Friday shared that he had been to this part of the island before when his people ate twenty men, two women, and one child. (22) He showed this by laying out stones because he couldn't count in English.

 (23) The master learned a lot from Friday. (24) He found out that their island was near a big river and another large island.

 (25) He asked Friday many questions about the lands nearby, the sea, and the people living there.

 (26) Friday told him everything openly. (27) He only knew his people as 'Caribs.' (28) The master realized they were near the area called the Caribbees on the maps.

 (29) Friday also mentioned white-bearded men far away who were mean to his people. (30) The master thought he was talking about the Spaniards.

 (31) Friday shared a lot, helping the master understand more about the area and its history.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Emma went to visit the Coles. (2) She had a lot of fun there. (3) The next day, she remembered all the good times she had. (4) Emma made the Coles very happy. (5) They liked having her around. (6) And everyone was still talking about her after she left.

 (7) Emma thought about her visit. (8) She was happy, but she had a couple of worries. (9) She thought maybe she shouldn't have shared her guesses about Jane Fairfax's feelings with Frank Churchill. (10) Emma wondered if she should have kept quiet. (11) Emma also felt a bit sad about her piano playing. (12) She knew she wasn't as good as Jane Fairfax. (13) This made her practice really hard for a long time.

 (14) While she was practicing, her friend Harriet came in. (15) Harriet started praising Emma's playing. (16) ""Oh! (17) if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"". (18) Harriet said. (19) ""Don't put us in the same group, Harriet. (20) My playing is much different from hers,"" Emma replied.

 (21) ""Oh! (22) dear—I think you play the best of the two. (23) I love listening to you play,"" said Harriet. (24) ""People who know about music can tell the difference,"" Emma explained. (25) ""I'm okay, but Jane is much better."". (26) ""But I still think you're just as good,"" Harriet insisted. (27) ""Mr. Cole and Mr. Frank Churchill also said you have great taste in music."".

 (28) ""Ah, but Jane Fairfax is good at both taste and how she plays,"" Emma said. 

(29) Emma appreciated Harriet's kind words, but she knew Jane was really good at playing piano. (30) Emma felt a little sad but also happy that her friend was so supportive.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) Nancy smiled brightly and said, ""I love Monday mornings!"".

 (2) ""That sounds funny, doesn't it?"". (3) she chuckled. (4) ""Let me tell you why. (5) I used to not like Mondays at all. (6) But then, a sweet little girl told me something special. (7) She said, 'Nancy, Mondays should make you happy because it's a whole week until the next one!'""

 (8) Nancy laughed. (9) ""Ever since she told me that, I think about it every Monday. (10) It really makes the day better!"". (11) Miss Polly looked confused. (12) ""But why didn't she tell me about the game?"". (13) she asked softly. (14) Nancy paused for a moment. (15) ""Well, Miss Polly, you asked her not to talk about her father. (16) The game was his idea."". (17) Miss Polly felt a little sad.

 (18) Nancy continued, ""She really wanted to share it with you at the beginning. (19) She wanted someone to play the game with her."". (20) ""And what about the others?"". (21) Miss Polly's voice was shaky. (22) ""Almost everyone knows about the game now,"" Nancy replied. (23) ""She told many people, and they shared it too. (24) It's easy to spread good things."". (25) Nancy smiled. (26) ""She's always so happy and kind to everyone. (27) That's why so many people learned the game from her."".

 (28) ""Since she's been hurt, people feel sad for her,"" Nancy added. (29) ""They've been visiting her to tell her how much her happiness has helped them. (30) They hope it makes her feel better."". (31) Nancy summed up, ""She always wanted everyone to join in her game of finding something to be glad about."".

 (32) Miss Polly nodded, finally understanding the beauty of the game.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) ""What's wrong with Mr. (2) Casaubon?"". (3) asked Sir James, looking quite puzzled. (4) ""I don’t see any problem if the girl likes him."".

 (5) ""But she's so young,"" responded another voice. (6) ""She might not really know what she likes. (7) Her guardian should help her decide. (8) He shouldn't let her rush into anything."". (9) Sir James nodded thoughtfully. (10) ""You’re a dad with daughters, Cadwallader. (11) How can you just stand by and not care?"". (12) ""I do care,"" said Cadwallader, chuckling a bit. (13) ""But you sound like Elinor. (14) She thinks I should talk to Mr. Brooke about it."".

 (15) ""But Mr. Casaubon is much older,"" Sir James continued, looking a bit upset. (16) ""He’s about fifty. (17) And honestly, he doesn't seem very lively."". (18) Cadwallader laughed again. (19) ""Young men like you think you're everyone's favorite. (20) But women don't always go for good looks. (21) Elinor used to tell her sisters she married me because my face was interestingly funny."".

 (22) Sir James wasn’t convinced. (23) ""It's not about looks. (24) I just don’t like Mr. (25) Casaubon."". (26) ""Why not?"". (27) Cadwallader asked, curious. (28) ""What’s wrong with him?"". (29) Sir James struggled to explain. (30) ""Well, does he even care about others?"". (31) ""Yes, he does,"" Cadwallader replied seriously. (32) ""He’s kind to his poor relatives. (33) He helps them a lot."". (34) ""That’s good of him,"" said Sir James, his face softening a bit.

 (35) ""But,"" he added quickly, ""just wanting to do good doesn’t mean he can make someone happy. (36) And Miss Brooke is very young. (37) Her family should help make sure she doesn’t do something silly."".

 (38) Cadwallader smiled. (39) ""Are you worried because you like her?"". (40) ""No, it’s not like that,"" Sir James said quickly. (41) ""I'd be just as worried if I were her brother or uncle."".

 (42) They both looked at each other, understanding a bit more about each other's concerns.

Paragraph: (1) Rebecca was chatting with Mr. Cobb as they rode in his carriage. (2) She said, ""I've read lots of books. (3) Books from school, from the Sunday-school, and even my dad's books."". (4) She listed many books she had read, like ""The Lamplighter"" and ""David Copperfield."".

 (5) Mr. Cobb replied, ""I haven't read those books, but I've read a lot in my days. (6) Now, I mostly read the Almanac and the Weekly Argus."".

 (7) As they talked, they were getting closer to Riverboro. (8) Mr. Cobb pointed out, ""There's the river again. (9) We're almost there. (10) We'll see Riverboro soon. (11) It's not far. (12) I live just a bit beyond your aunt's house."". (13) Rebecca felt a bit nervous and moved in her seat. (14) ""I didn't think I'd be scared,"" she whispered, ""but I guess I am, just a little."".

 (15) Mr. Cobb asked her, ""Would you want to go back?"".

 (16) Rebecca looked at him bravely and said, ""I'd never go back. (17) I might be scared, but I wouldn't run away. (18) Going to Aunt Mirandy’s is scary like going into a dark basement. (19) There might be scary things, but there could also be fairies and enchanted frogs!"".

 (20) She then asked, ""Is there a main street in the village, like in Wareham?"".

 (21) Mr. Cobb replied, ""Well, it's sort of a main street. (22) Your Aunt Sawyer lives on it. (23) But there are no shops or mills. (24) It's a very small village. (25) You need to cross the river to see anything exciting."".

 (26) Rebecca sighed, ""I'm almost sorry. (27) I imagined driving down a busy main street, sitting up high in this carriage. (28) It would be wonderful, like being in a parade. (29) I remember last summer when the circus came to town. (30) They had a parade with horses, clowns, and even a snake charmer in a tiny chariot. (31) She looked so magical. (32) It made you feel all shivery inside. (33) Have you ever felt that way when you saw something amazing, Mr. (34) Cobb?"". (35) Mr. Cobb smiled as he listened to Rebecca's vivid memories and her dreams about their arrival. (36) They continued their journey, nearing Rebecca's new home with every clip-clop of the horses' hooves.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) Last week, Dr. Mead finally came to visit. (2) He was very tall and looked strong. (3) His eyes were kind and gray, and he always had a smile. (4) Pollyanna really liked him and she told him right away.

 (5) ""You remind me of my doctor,"" she told him with a smile.

 (6) ""Your doctor?"". (7) asked Dr. Mead, looking surprised. (8) Dr. Warren, who was nearby, was much shorter and had brown eyes and a pointy beard.

 (9) ""Oh, Dr. Warren isn't my doctor,"" explained Pollyanna quickly. (10) ""He's my Aunt Polly's doctor. (11) My doctor is Dr. (12) Chilton."". (13) ""Oh,"" said Dr. Mead, looking a little confused.

 (14) Pollyanna noticed her aunt looked embarrassed and turned away.

 (15) ""You see, I really wanted Dr. Chilton to come,"" Pollyanna continued, ""but Aunt Polly chose you because she thinks you know more about fixing broken legs like mine."".

 (16) ""Do you know more?"". (17) Pollyanna asked curiously. (18) Dr. Mead didn't answer right away. (19) ""We'll see in time,"" he said kindly. (20) Just then, Dr. Warren came over to talk to them.

 (21) The cat, Fluffy, was about to cause a bit of trouble. (22) She pushed against Pollyanna's door until it opened a bit. (23) If that hadn't happened, Pollyanna wouldn't have heard something important.

 (24) In the hall, the two doctors, a nurse, and Miss Polly were talking. (25) In Pollyanna's room, Fluffy jumped onto the bed and meowed happily. (26) Just then, Pollyanna heard her aunt say something that sounded really worried, through the open door.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) ""Dorothea, it would be amazing to be his friend,"" said Dorothea with excitement.

 (2) ""Do you like him?"". (3) Mr. Brooke asked. (4) He didn't look surprised. (5) ""I've known Mr. Casaubon for ten years. (6) He's a very smart man. (7) He might even become a bishop someday!"". (8) Dorothea didn't say anything.

 (9) ""Mr. Casaubon thinks very highly of you,"" her uncle continued. (10) ""He talks very nicely too. (11) Since you're still young, he asked me first if he could talk to you about something important."".

 (12) Mr. Brooke looked at Dorothea, trying to guess what she was thinking. (13) ""He wants to ask you to marry him,"" he said slowly.

 (14) ""Thank you, uncle,"" Dorothea said clearly. (15) ""I respect Mr. Casaubon a lot. (16) If he asks me, I will say yes."". (17) Mr. Brooke seemed a bit surprised. (18) ""Well, that's good to hear. (19) He's a good choice. (20) But remember, Sir James Chettam is also interested in marrying you. (21) Our lands are next to each other."". (22) ""I will never marry Sir James Chettam,"" Dorothea replied firmly. (23) ""He shouldn't think about marrying me."". (24) ""People can be surprising,"" Mr. Brooke said. (25) ""I thought Sir James would be just right for you."".

 (26) ""Please don't talk about him like that,"" Dorothea said, a bit annoyed.

 (27) Mr. Brooke was puzzled. (28) Women were really hard to understand, he thought. (29) Sir James didn't stand a chance. (30) ""But about Mr. Casaubon, take your time. (31) He's much older than you. (32) Although he's wealthy and smart, he's not very young. (33) And I worry a bit about his health."". (34) ""That's all I know about him,"" Mr. Brooke finished, hoping he had given Dorothea enough to think about.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) ""Uncle Jerry watched her walk down the hill and sighed, 'Poor little unlucky thing! (2) I wish she would watch where she's going. (3) But if she were mine, I'd let her paint all over the house before I'd scold her. (4) Look, she left her poem here. (5) Read it again, mother.'"" (6) ""Uncle Jerry laughed and lit his pipe. (7) 'I can imagine the editor running away as Rebecca takes his chair! (8) Editing must be an interesting job, but Rebecca will learn it quickly. (9) She'll be a great editor!'"" (10) ""He read a line from her poem, 'The thought that God has planned it so should help us bear the years.' (11) 'Wow, mother, that sounds like something from the Bible. (12) How did she come up with that?'"" (13) ""'She probably didn't think it through,' said Mrs. Cobb. (14) 'Some things we just know without being told, Jeremiah.'""

 (15) ""Rebecca had gotten into trouble earlier. (16) She deserved it, but it still was hard. (17) Miss Miranda had scolded her a lot. (18) She even said Rebecca might grow up to be very silly if she wasn't careful."".

 (19) ""Rebecca was also told she couldn't go to Alice Robinson's birthday party. (20) And she had to wear her stained dress until it wore out. (21) That was tough."". (22) ""But Aunt Jane helped her after six months. (23) She made Rebecca a pretty cover-up to hide the stains."".

 (24) ""When Rebecca was alone, she thought about what had happened. (25) She didn't want to become silly. (26) So, she decided to try harder to be good."". (27) ""She didn't mind missing Alice's party. (28) She had told her friend, Emma Jane, that the party at Alice's would be boring. (29) The Robinsons' house was always so quiet and dull."".

 (30) ""Kids had to enter through the back door at Alice's house. (31) They had to stand on newspapers so they wouldn't make a mess."".

 (32) ""Alice's mom was very tidy and didn't spend much. (33) So, the party snacks were probably just mints and water."".

 (34) ""Rebecca knew she could find fun in other ways and maybe even become a great editor one day! (35) "".

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) The day before Rebecca left for her trip to the South with Miss Maxwell, she was in the library with her friends, Emma Jane and Huldah. (2) They were looking through big books to find some information.

 (3) Before they left the library, they walked by some locked bookcases. (4) These bookcases were filled with storybooks that were only for teachers and local people to read, not for students like them. (5) But the friends loved to peek through the glass and look at the book titles.

 (6) Rebecca saw a new book in the corner. (7) She read the title out loud and smiled. (8) ""The Rose of Joy. (9) Listen, girls; doesn't that sound pretty? (10) The Rose of Joy. (11) It looks wonderful too. (12) I wonder what it means?"". (13) Huldah thought for a moment and said, ""I think everyone’s 'Rose of Joy' might be different. (14) For me, it would be living in a big city with lots of money to spend and pretty clothes. (15) And I'd be around fancy people all the time."". (16) ""That would be fun,"" Emma Jane agreed. (17) ""But would that really be joy, or just fun? (18) Oh, I just had an idea!"". (19) ""Don't scare me like that!"". (20) Huldah jumped. (21) ""I thought you saw a mouse."". (22) ""Sorry,"" Emma Jane giggled. (23) ""I don’t get ideas very often. (24) But this one hit me like lightning. (25) Rebecca, what if 'The Rose of Joy' is all about success?"".

 (26) ""That’s a nice thought,"" Rebecca said, thinking hard. (27) ""Success would bring joy, but it doesn’t quite feel like a rose. (28) Maybe it could be love?"". (29) ""I wish we could read that book!"". (30) Emma Jane sighed. (31) ""But hearing you say 'love' makes me think that might be the right answer."".

 (32) Rebecca kept thinking about those words all day. (33) ""The Rose of Joy,"" she repeated to herself over and over. (34) Even Emma Jane, who usually didn’t think about such things, seemed touched by the words.

 (35) That evening, while helping Rebecca feel better with some cologne, Emma Jane had another bright idea. (36) ""I might be right or wrong, but what if 'The Rose of Joy’ is being helpful to others?"". 

(37) All these guesses made their day quite exciting as they imagined what ""The Rose of Joy"" could truly mean.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) Rebecca had to remind Mr. Cobb again, with just a look, to be careful. (2) She looked quickly and then looked away. (3) ""Paris is the capital of France,"" she told him. (4) ""You can get there by boat. (5) It's in my geography book."". (6) She smiled as she talked about what she learned. (7) ""The book says French people like to dance and are very polite. (8) They also like 'light wines,' which might be like cider or ginger pop."".

 (9) Rebecca liked to imagine Paris. (10) ""I can see it when I close my eyes,"" she said. (11) ""There are beautiful ladies with pink sunshades and beaded purses. (12) The gentlemen are nice and drink ginger pop while they dance."".

 (13) ""But we see Milltown all the time,"" Rebecca sighed.

 (14) Mr. Cobb wasn't impressed by big cities. (15) ""Milltown isn’t much,"" he said, like he'd seen every city there was.

 (16) ""Watch this!"". (17) he then said. (18) He threw a newspaper perfectly onto Mrs. Brown's doorstep. (19) It landed right on the mat. (20) ""Wow!"". (21) Rebecca exclaimed. (22) ""You threw it just like a circus knife thrower!"".

 (23) ""I wish there were lots of houses in a row,"" she dreamed out loud. (24) ""Each one could have a mat and a door, and I could throw a newspaper on each."".

 (25) Mr. Cobb laughed. (26) ""I might miss some,"" he admitted. (27) ""If your aunt Mirandy says it’s okay, I'll take you to Milltown this summer,"" he offered, if there was space in the stagecoach.

 (28) Rebecca was so excited. (29) It felt like a dream to think she might visit Milltown. (30) ""It's like having a fairy godmother!"". (31) she exclaimed. (32) ""Have you ever read 'Cinderella' or 'The Yellow Dwarf'?"". (33) she asked Mr. Cobb. (34) Mr. Cobb thought for a bit. (35) ""No, I can’t say I have,"" he answered. (36) ""Where do you get to read so many stories?"". (37) Rebecca beamed, thrilled at the thought of adventures, both in books and maybe even in Milltown one day.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) Rosamond was talking to her dad, Mr. Vincy, when she turned very pale. (2) ""Is it about Tertius?"". (3) she asked. (4) She felt worried because something didn't make sense to her.

 (5) ""Oh dear,"" her dad said. (6) ""You married into some tough times. (7) Not only debts but even worse things."". (8) ""Wait, Lucy,"" Mr. Vincy said. (9) ""Rosamond, did you hear anything about your uncle Bulstrode?"".

 (10) ""No, papa,"" Rosamond replied, feeling very scared. (11) It was like an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, making her feel weak.

 (12) Her dad decided to tell her everything. (13) ""It's better you know, my dear. (14) I think Lydgate, your husband, might have to leave town. (15) Things haven't gone well for him. (16) I don't think it's his fault, though."". (17) This news really upset Rosamond. (18) She thought no one could have it as tough as she did now. (19) She believed marrying Lydgate was going to be wonderful, but now it felt like a mistake. (20) She didn’t tell her parents much about how she felt and only said that Lydgate should have left town earlier.

 (21) Her mom noticed how strong Rosamond was being. (22) ""She's handling it so well,"" her mom said. (23) ""Thank God,"" said Mr. Vincy, feeling very sad.

 (24) Rosamond felt really upset with Lydgate. (25) She wondered what he had actually done. (26) Why hadn’t he told her everything? (27) He didn't talk about it, and she felt she couldn’t ask him.

 (28) She thought about asking her dad if she could move back home. (29) But that idea felt too sad. (30) She couldn’t imagine being a married woman living with her parents again. (31) It just didn't feel right to her. (32) A couple of days passed, and Lydgate noticed Rosamond was acting differently. (33) He wondered if she would talk to him about the bad news. (34) The silence between them was very hard for him. (35) He knew he should have shared everything with her, but now it was even harder to break the silence.

 (36) Both felt very alone, even though they were together. (37) It was like they were both stuck on a piece of broken ship, not looking at each other.

 (9) Mrs. Weston shook her head. (10) ""I think you must be mistaken. (11) I don't remember writing about that."". (12) Frank insisted, ""You must remember! (13) Mrs. Perry was so happy about it. (14) She thought it would keep Mr. Perry warm and dry in bad weather."".

 (15) Mrs. Weston was still confused. (16) ""I really don’t recall such a plan."". (17) Just then, Mr. Weston joined in the conversation. (18) ""A carriage for Perry? (19) That's great news! (20) Did he tell you himself?"". (21) Frank chuckled. (22) ""No, Dad. (23) It seems I was wrong. (24) I thought Mrs. Weston told me, but she didn’t."". (25) Mr. Weston laughed a little. (26) ""It's funny how dreams can seem so real, isn't it?"".

 (27) Frank agreed. (28) ""Yes, I must have dreamt it. (29) I often dream about folks back here when I'm away."".

 (30) His father replied, ""Dreams can be so strange. (31) They make you think!"". (32) As they walked on, Mrs. Weston smiled. (33) ""It does show you care about everyone here, even in your dreams!"".

 (34) And so, they continued walking, chatting about dreams and friends, enjoying the sunny day together.
