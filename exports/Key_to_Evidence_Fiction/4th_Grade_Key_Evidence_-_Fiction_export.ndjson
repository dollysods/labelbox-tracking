(2) She started selling things at the market. (3) She was so pretty that people would buy things from her without even taking them.\n\n (4) They did this for a while until one day, a soldier rode his horse into her stall and broke everything. (5) The woman was very upset and didn't know what to do. (6) She ran home to tell her husband. (7) He was disappointed and told her that selling at the market was not a good job for her.\n\n (8) Instead, her husband found her a job at the king’s palace as a kitchen maid. (9) She helped the cook with all the hardest jobs but got to bring home some leftover food.\n\n (10) While working at the palace, she heard that the king’s son was getting married. (11) She peeked out of the window to see the grand event. (12) She felt sad about how her choices had changed her life so much.\n\n (13) One day, the king’s son walked in wearing golden clothes. (14) He saw the woman and asked her to dance. (15) She was scared because she knew he was making fun of her. (16) As they danced, the food from her basket fell out, and everyone laughed.\n\n (17) She tried to leave, but the king's son stopped her. (18) He told her not to be afraid. (19) He said he was the fiddler who had lived with her before and even the soldier who broke her stall. (20) He explained that he did all that because he loved her and wanted her to see how her pride was not good.\n\n (21) He had hoped to teach her a lesson. (22) Now that she had learned it, he said it was time for them to get married.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Why did he want to marry her?\",\n

(2) The trucks on the streets splashed gray, dirty snow around. (3) The sky was cloudy and dark. (4) He felt very sad as he walked. (5) He had broken a law about mail because he didn't want his friend, Mr. Graff, to go to jail or make Mr. Graff's wife sad. (6) Now, he had to fire Mr. Graff, which made him even more upset. (7) He didn't like making people feel bad because he wanted everyone to like him.\n\n (8) Suddenly, Miss McGoun came rushing in, looking excited. (9) She said, \"He's here!\". (10) \"Mr. Graff? (11) Please ask him to come in,\" the man replied. (12) He tried to sit calmly in his chair as Mr. Graff walked in. (13) Mr. Graff looked neat and was wearing glasses. (14) \"Need me?\". (15) Mr. Graff asked. (16) \"Yes. (17) Please sit down,\" said the man. (18) But Mr. Graff kept standing and started talking, \"You must have heard from Mr. Varney. (19) Let me tell you, he was not honest about the house rent. (20) Then, another person wanted the house for more money, and I thought it was best for our company to let Mr. Varney go. (21) I really didn't mean to do anything wrong.\". (22) \"Stan, I understand, but I've had many complaints about you,\" the man explained. (23) \"I believe you don't mean harm, and a good lesson might help you do better. (24) But I can't keep you in the job.\". (25) Mr. Graff laughed and said, \"So, I'm fired! (26) I know I did some wrong things, but it's tough here.\".\n\n (27) \"Now, young man,\" the boss started to say.\n\n (28) \"Please, no shouting,\" Mr. Graff interrupted. (29) \"Everyone outside can hear us. (30) I know we've both made mistakes, but if I had a better salary, things would be different. (31) I just got married, and it's hard to have enough money.\".\n\n (32) The man listened, feeling mixed up inside.

(2) Just a second. (3) I feel a bit dizzy and couldn't get out of bed until now. (4) I am still lying here but don't worry, I’m feeling better. (5) I am getting up right now. (6) Please be patient with me. (7) It’s a bit harder than I thought to get up when you feel dizzy. (8) But, I’m okay now, really. (9) It's strange how quickly someone can feel sick! (10) I was fine last night, and my parents knew I had a small sign of feeling unwell then. (11) They must have noticed something was off. (12) I should have told you earlier at work! (13) Sometimes, we think we can get through the day without staying home when we're sick. (14) Please don't upset my parents! (15) There’s really no reason for anyone to be making accusations. (16) Maybe you missed the latest reports I sent in. (17) I plan to catch the eight o'clock train after resting a bit more. (18) You don’t have to wait for me, sir; I'll come to the office shortly after you. (19) Could you please let the boss know that? (20) While saying all this, Gregor tried to get out of bed. (21) He moved towards his chest of drawers, which he reached quite easily, maybe because he had tried a few times already. (22) He really wanted to open the door to talk to the chief clerk and show himself. (23) The others outside were insisting a lot, and Gregor was eager to see their reaction when they saw him. (24) If they were shocked, it wouldn't be his fault anymore, and he could relax. (25) But if they were okay with it, he wouldn’t need to worry, and he could still make it to his train at eight.\n\n (26) At first, Gregor kept slipping when he tried to climb the smooth chest of drawers, but after one big push, he managed to stand upright. (27) His lower body hurt a lot, but he ignored the pain. (28) Then, he leaned against a chair and held on tight with his legs. (29) After a while, he calmed down and stayed quiet to hear what the chief clerk was saying outside.\n\n (30) \"Did you understand any of that?\". (31) the chief clerk asked Gregor's parents, doubtful of Gregor’s words. (32) \"Oh, God!\". (33) Gregor’s mom cried out, already crying, \"He might be really sick, and we are just making it worse. (34) Grete! (35) Grete!\". (36) she called for his sister. (37) \"Mother?\". (38) Grete replied from across the room. (39) They talked through the room, worried. (40) \"You need to get the doctor right away. (41) Gregor is sick. (42) Hurry, call the doctor. (43) Did you hear how strange Gregor sounded?\". (44) \"That sounded like an animal,\" the chief clerk remarked calmly, contrasting with his mother's worried cries.\n\n (45) \"Anna! (46) Anna!\". (47) Gregor’s father shouted towards the kitchen, clapping his hands, \"We need a locksmith now!\". (48) The two girls, Grete and her mother, quickly ran through the hall, their skirts swishing, and flung open the front door. (49) Gregor wondered how his sister got ready so fast. (50) The door didn’t slam shut; it stayed open. (51) Sometimes, doors stay open in houses where something unexpected has happened.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who wondered about his sister

(2) As the candles slowly burned lower, Miss Havisham stared into the fireplace for a long time. (3) Suddenly, some red coals collapsed with a small noise, and she looked towards Pip again. (4) Estella kept knitting calmly while all of this was happening.\n\n (5) Miss Havisham broke the silence and asked Pip, \"What else?\".\n\n (6) Pip turned to Estella and said, trying to keep his voice steady, “Estella, you know I love you. (7) You know I’ve loved you for a very long time.”\n\nEstella looked up at Pip while she continued knitting, but her face didn’t show any feelings. (8) Pip noticed that Miss Havisham was watching them both carefully.\n\n (9) Pip continued, “I should have told you this earlier, but I always thought Miss Havisham wanted us to be together. (10) That hope stopped me from speaking. (11) But now, I need to tell you.”\n\nEstella kept her face calm and shook her head as she knitted.\n\n (12) Pip sadly said, “I know, Estella. (13) I know you might never love me back. (14) I don’t know what my future holds, or where I’ll be, but I still love you. (15) I’ve loved you since the first day I saw you here.”\n\n\n\nEstella shook her head again without showing any emotion.\n\n (16) Pip felt a bit sad and said, \"It would have been very mean if Miss Havisham had made me hope for something that was never going to happen. (17) But I think she didn’t realize what she was doing because she had her own problems.”\n\n\n\nJust then, Miss Havisham put her hand on her heart, looking back and forth between Pip and Estella.\n\n (18) Estella spoke calmly, saying, \"I don’t really understand feelings well, Pip. (19) When you say you love me, I hear the words, but they don’t mean anything to me. (20) I’ve tried to tell you this before, haven’t I?”\n\nPip replied quietly, “Yes.”\n\n\n\nEstella continued, \"But you didn’t believe me, did you? (21) You thought I didn’t really mean it.\". (22) Pip admitted, “I hoped you didn’t mean it. (23) You’re so young and beautiful, Estella! (24) It just didn’t seem possible.”\n\nEstella looked serious and said, “But it is possible, Pip. (25) It's just how I am. (26) I’ve told you this because I want to be honest with you. (27) I can’t feel things the way you do.”\n\nPip listened to Estella’s words, feeling a mix of sadness and understanding. (28) He knew Estella was different from anyone else he knew. (29) And even though it was hard, he accepted that she was just being honest with him.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What emotion did Pip feel

(2) We're not sure what to tell him, and he really wants to talk to you. (3) So, could you please open your door? (4) I'm sure he won't mind the mess in your room.\". (5) Then, the chief clerk greeted, \"Good morning, Mr. (6) Samsa.\". (7) Gregor's mom whispered to the chief clerk, \"He's not feeling well, please understand. (8) Gregor would never miss a train unless he was really sick. (9) He always thinks about his job.\". (10) Gregor’s dad added, \"He’s been so focused on work. (11) He doesn't even go out at night. (12) He's been with us every evening for a week, just sitting in the kitchen, reading the newspaper or looking at train schedules.\".\n\n (13) \"He relaxes by working on his woodworking projects,\" continued his dad. (14) \"He made a beautiful little frame in just a few nights. (15) It's hanging in his room. (16) You'll see it when he opens the door.\". (17) \"We're really glad you’re here,\" said Gregor's dad. (18) \"We couldn’t get him to open the door ourselves. (19) He’s quite stubborn, and I'm sure he's not well. (20) He claimed he was fine this morning, but he's not.\".\n\n (21) Gregor, listening from inside, responded slowly, \"I'll be there in a moment.\". (22) But he stayed still, not wanting to miss any part of the conversation.\n\n (23) The chief clerk said to Gregor's mom, \"I hope it’s nothing serious. (24) But we in business must push through illness sometimes.\".\n\n (25) Gregor's dad asked again, \"Can the chief clerk come in now?\".\n\n (26) Gregor answered from his room, \"No.\".\n\n (27) After his response, the house went quiet. (28) In the next room, Gregor's sister began to cry. (29) Why didn't she join the others? (30) She probably just woke up and wasn't dressed yet. (31) And why was she crying? (32) Maybe because Gregor hadn’t gotten up, which could mean trouble at his job. (33) But Gregor wasn't planning to leave his family behind. (34) For now, he just lay there, not letting anyone in. (35) He wasn't being rude on purpose. (36) They could explain it later. (37) Gregor thought it best to be left alone rather than upset by the conversation and his sister’s tears. (38) The others were worried, but they didn't understand what was going on.

(2) The fog was so thick that the light from the street lamps looked strange and blurry. (3) As we walked, we talked about how the mist changed with the wind from the marshes.\n\n (4) Soon, we saw a man named Orlick hiding under a shelter. (5) \"Hello!\". (6) we called out, stopping near him. (7) He came out and said he was waiting for some company. (8) I noticed he was out late, and he said we were late too. (9) Mr. Wopsle told him we had spent the evening enjoying a play.\n\n (10) Orlick didn't seem too interested in our play. (11) We all walked on together. (12) I asked him if he had spent his day off walking around town. (13) He said yes, and that he was just behind us most of the time. (14) He mentioned that he heard guns firing from the direction of the Hulks, a place where prisoners were kept.\n\n (15) \"Yes, some prisoners have escaped,\" he explained. (16) \"That's why they're firing the guns. (17) It's a good night for them to try to run away.\". (18) As we walked, we heard the deep sound of the cannon through the fog, rolling over the fields by the river. (19) The sound made the night feel even darker and scarier.\n\n (20) Mr. Wopsle seemed lost in his own thoughts, probably still thinking about his play. (21) Orlick walked beside me, his hands in his pockets, looking grumpy and tired. (22) The road was wet and muddy, making our walk messy and slippery.\n\n (23) Every so often, the sound of the cannon would boom through the night again. (24) I kept quiet, lost in my own thoughts about the escaped prisoners.\n\n (25) Finally, we reached our village. (26) We walked past the Three Jolly Bargemen, a local inn. (27) It was lively and noisy, even though it was very late. (28) Mr. Wopsle went inside to see what was going on. (29) He came out quickly, looking worried. (30) \"There's trouble,\" he said as he ran by us. (31) \"At your house, Pip. (32) Hurry!\". (33) I ran after him, asking what happened. (34) Orlick ran with us. (35) Mr. Wopsle shouted back that someone had broken into the house while Joe Gargery, who I lived with, was out. (36) He thought it might have been the convicts. (37) Someone had been hurt. (38) We all ran as fast as we could toward my house, anxious and scared about what we'd find.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who did Mr. Wopsle

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r087jn1y3k0718t1uej7v5", "global_key": "024f4_4_16", "row_data": "Grade level: 4 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Babbitt\n\nBook Author: Sinclair Lewis\n\nParagraph: (1) sat smoking with the piano-salesman, clinging to the warm refuge of gossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. (2) He was the more affable on the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more hollow. (3) He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla’s knowledge, and that he was doing things not at all moral and secure. (4) When the salesman yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt left him, left the hotel, in leisurely calm. (5) But savagely he said “Campbell Inn!” to the taxi-driver. (6) He sat agitated on the slippery leather seat, in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume and Turkish cigarettes. (7) He did not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark spaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the Loop.\n\n (8) The office of the Campbell Inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk harder and brighter. (9) “Yep?” he said to Babbitt. (10) “Mr. (11) Paul Riesling registered here?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n\n\n“Is he in now?”\n\n\n\n“Nope.”\n\n\n\n“Then if you’ll give me his key, I’ll wait for him.”\n\n\n\n“Can’t do that, brother. (12) Wait down here if you wanna.”\n\nBabbitt had spoken with the deference which all the Clan of Good Fellows give to hotel clerks. (13) Now he said with snarling abruptness:\n\n“I may have to wait some time. (14) I’m Riesling’s brother-in-law. (15) I’ll go up to his room. (16) D’ I look like a sneak-thief?”\n\nHis voice was low and not pleasant. (17) With considerable haste the clerk took down the key, protesting, “I never saidyou looked like a sneak-thief. (18) Just rules of the hotel. (19) But if you want to—”\n\nOn his way up in the elevator Babbitt wondered why he was here. (20) Why shouldn’t Paul be dining with a respectable married woman? (21) Why had he lied to the clerk about being Paul’s brother-in-law? (22) He had acted like a child. (23) He must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul. (24) As he settled down he tried to look pompous and placid. (25) Then the thought— Suicide. (26) He’d been dreading that, without knowing it. (27) Paul would be just the person to do something like that. (28) He must be out of his head or he wouldn’t be confiding in that—that dried-up hag.\n\n (29) Zilla (oh, damn Zilla! (30) how gladly he’d throttle that nagging fiend of a woman! (31) )—she’d probably succeeded at last, and driven Paul crazy.\n\n (32) Suicide. (33) Out there in the lake, way out, beyond the piled ice along the shore. (34) It would be ghastly cold to drop into the water to-night.\n\n (35) Or—throat cut—in the bathroom—\n\n\n\nBabbitt flung into Paul’s bathroom. (36) It was empty. (37) He smiled, feebly. (38) He pulled at his choking collar, looked at his watch, opened the window to stare down at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. (39) Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.\n\n (40) And he waited for three hours.\n\n (41) He was sitting fixed, chilled, when the doorknob turned. (42) Paul came in glowering. (43) “Hello,” Paul said. (44) “Been waiting?”\n\n“Yuh, little while.”\n\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n\n“Well what? (45) Just thought I’d drop in to see how you made out in Akron.”\n\n\n\n“I did all right.

Montgomery\n\nParagraph: (1) Marilla thought she had a good plan to teach Anne a lesson about behaving well. (2) But something didn't seem quite right. (3) Anne looked too happy, which wasn't the plan at all.\n\n (4) Anne was glowing with a smile until she saw Mrs. Lynde. (5) Mrs. Lynde was knitting by her window. (6) Suddenly, Anne looked very sad. (7) She went right up to Mrs. Lynde and knelt down in front of her with her hands together.\n\n (8) \"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I'm really, really sorry,\" Anne said, her voice shaking a little. (9) \"I was so mean to you, and I feel awful about it. (10) I can't even tell you how sorry I am; you'll have to imagine it. (11) I've embarrassed my friends, Matthew and Marilla, who took me in at Green Gables even though they wanted a boy, not a girl like me.\".\n\n (12) \"I know I acted badly when I got mad after you told me the truth. (13) You were right—my hair is red, and I do have freckles. (14) I shouldn't have said mean things back to you. (15) Please forgive me, Mrs. Lynde. (16) If you don't, it will make me sad forever. (17) But I think you're too kind to stay mad at a little girl, even if she lost her temper. (18) Please?\". (19) Anne looked up hopefully and waited. (20) She really meant every word she said. (21) Marilla and Mrs. Lynde could tell she was sincere. (22) But Marilla was worried because it seemed like Anne was almost happy to be apologizing so deeply.\n\n (23) Where was the lesson in all of this? (24) Marilla had hoped Anne would learn from a good, strict punishment. (25) Instead, Anne seemed to find joy in saying sorry and making things right.

Montgomery\n\nParagraph: (1) When school ended, Anne walked out proudly with her head up high. (2) Gilbert Blythe waited for her by the door. (3) \"I'm really sorry I teased you about your hair, Anne,\" he said quietly. (4) \"I mean it. (5) Please don't stay mad.\". (6) But Anne ignored him and walked past without even looking at him. (7) \"Anne, how could you ignore him?\". (8) Diana asked as they walked away. (9) She was a bit upset but also impressed. (10) \"I could never have done that.\". (11) \"I will never forgive Gilbert Blythe,\" Anne declared. (12) \"And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an 'e' too. (13) It really upset me, Diana.\". (14) Diana didn't quite understand what Anne meant, but she knew it was something big.\n\n (15) \"Don't worry about Gilbert teasing you,\" Diana tried to comfort her. (16) \"He teases all of us. (17) He even calls me a crow because my hair is so black. (18) And he's never said sorry for that.\". (19) \"But being called 'carrots' is different from being called a crow,\" Anne replied, feeling very hurt by Gilbert's words.\n\n (20) Things might have gotten better, but sometimes when one thing goes wrong, more troubles come.\n\n (21) The kids from Avonlea school often went to Mr. Bell's spruce grove to get gum during their lunch break. (22) From there, they could see Mr. Phillips' place. (23) When they saw him leave, they'd rush back to school. (24) But since it was a longer run, they usually got back late, out of breath.\n\n (25) The next day, Mr. Phillips decided to change things. (26) Before lunch, he told everyone that he expected them all to be in their seats when he got back.

(2) All he was trying to do was turn around to go back to his room. (3) Turning around was hard because he was in pain, so he used his head to push against the floor to help himself move. (4) When he stopped and looked back, his family seemed to understand he didn't mean to frighten them. (5) They were all quiet and looked sad. (6) His mom was sitting in a chair, looking very tired, with her eyes almost closed. (7) His sister was holding their dad around his neck. (8) Gregor thought to himself, \"Maybe now they'll let me go back.\". (9) He started trying to turn around again, taking breaks because it was tough and he needed to catch his breath.\n\n (10) No one rushed him this time; he could move at his own pace. (11) When he finally got turned around, he moved straight toward his room. (12) He was surprised at how far his room seemed and wondered how he had managed to come that far before.\n\n (13) He focused on crawling fast and didn't notice that his family was completely silent. (14) When he reached his room's door, he didn't look back until the last moment. (15) He only saw that his sister had gotten up and his mom had fallen asleep.\n\n (16) As soon as Gregor got into his room, the door was quickly shut, bolted, and locked. (17) The loud noise made Gregor's legs give way, and he collapsed. (18) It was his sister who had locked the door. (19) She had been waiting and moved quickly. (20) Gregor hadn't heard her coming. (21) As she locked the door, she said to their parents, \"At last!\".\n\n (22) Gregor then wondered what to do next as he was in the dark room. (23) He soon realized he couldn't move at all. (24) This didn't surprise him; it felt strange that he could have moved before on his thin legs. (25) Despite the pain in his body, he felt somewhat comfortable.\n\n (26) The pain was slowly going away, and he could barely feel the old apple stuck in his back. (27) He thought about his family with love and emotion. (28) He felt he should leave, even more than his sister thought he should. (29) He stayed in his thoughts until he heard the clock strike three in the morning.\n\n (30) As it began to get light outside, Gregor's head dropped down, and he breathed his last breath.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What time did he hear the clock strike?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"27\": \"He

(2) He sent a postcard to a lady named Zilla when he was in Akron, telling her he met Paul there. (3) Later, he went to visit Zilla at her house. (4) Zilla looked very different at home. (5) She wore a blue dressing-gown and pink slippers. (6) Her hair wasn't as nice as before, and she sat in a rocking chair surrounded by candy boxes and magazines. (7) She didn't seem very happy. (8) When Mr. Babbitt saw her, he tried to be cheerful and said, \"Hello, Zil! (9) Are you enjoying your day while your husband is away? (10) That's great! (11) Hey, can I borrow your thermos? (12) We’re having a sledding party and want to take some coffee with us. (13) Oh, did you get my postcard?\". (14) Zilla replied, \"Yes. (15) What was Paul doing?\". (16) \"What do you mean?\". (17) Mr. Babbitt asked as he sat down. (18) Zilla was upset. (19) \"I suppose he was meeting other women!\". (20) Mr. Babbitt didn't like that. (21) \"You always think Paul is doing something wrong. (22) He's not like that. (23) Maybe if you weren't so hard on him, he wouldn't be away.\".\n\n (24) \"He really is in Akron?\". (25) Zilla asked, still worried. (26) \"I thought he might be seeing someone else.\". (27) \"I told you I saw him there. (28) Why don't you believe me?\". (29) Mr. Babbitt was getting frustrated. (30) \"I just get so worried,\" Zilla said.\n\n (31) Mr. Babbitt sighed. (32) \"You love Paul, but you're always so tough on him. (33) I don't understand why you do that.\". (34) \"You do the same with Ted and Rone,\" Zilla pointed out.\n\n (35) \"That's different,\" Mr. Babbitt said quickly. (36) \"And I don't really nag them.\". (37) He continued, \"Paul is a good guy. (38) You should be nicer to him. (39) You shouldn't talk to him so harshly.\". (40) Zilla looked sad. (41) \"I know. (42) Sometimes I'm mean, and I feel bad later. (43) But, oh, Georgie, Paul can be so irritating! (44) I try to be nice, but he still thinks it's always my fault. (45) And when he gets quiet, it makes me so upset that I end up saying things I don't mean.\".\n\n (46) Mr. Babbitt listened as Zilla explained how hard it was when Paul ignored her.

(2) We both know I'm not very tough, and you're very gentle.\".\n\n (3) \"Let it go?\". (4) Zilla replied, her face crinkling up like a scary mask. (5) Her voice was sharp and harsh. (6) She was upset and felt very right about it. (7) \"Let it go? (8) I've let go of so many things!\". (9) \"Stop being a bully, Zilla,\" Paul replied quietly.\n\n (10) \"If I didn't push you, you'd just sleep late and play your violin all night,\" Zilla argued. (11) \"You're naturally lazy and scared, Paul.\". (12) Mrs. Babbitt stepped in, trying to calm things down. (13) \"Oh, Zilla, don't be so hard on him. (14) You don't mean those things.\". (15) \"I mean every word,\" Zilla snapped back.\n\n (16) Mrs. Babbitt was worried. (17) She cared a lot and wanted to help. (18) \"You shouldn't speak to Paul that way!\". (19) Zilla ignored her and continued, \"If it weren't for me, we'd have nothing!\".\n\n (20) Mrs. Babbitt tried a different approach. (21) \"Paul's been working so hard. (22) It would be nice if he could take a little trip with George. (23) I'm sending George to Maine to relax before we all go.\".\n\n (24) Paul was shocked to hear his plans being discussed openly.\n\n (25) Zilla laughed mockingly. (26) \"Lucky you, not having to keep an eye on George!\".\n\n (27) Babbitt jumped into the conversation, defending his actions.\n\n (28) Paul, trying to stay calm, said to Zilla, \"So, you think I have lots of secret friends?\".\n\n (29) \"Yes, I do!\". (30) Zilla exclaimed. (31) Paul replied softly, \"Well, my dear, it seems you know less than you think.\".\n\n (32) Zilla was furious, shouting so much that her words were jumbled.\n\n (33) Then Mr. Babbitt got really upset. (34) He stood up tall and looked very serious. (35) \"Enough of this nonsense, Zilla! (36) I've known you for twenty-five years, and you've always been tough on Paul. (37) You're not being fair. (38) Paul is a wonderful person, and everyone is tired of you being mean. (39) You act as if you're in charge of everything. (40) Can't you see how this makes people feel?\".

(2) She went to work for Sanders, Torrey and Wing, who are his biggest competitors. (3) This news really scared Mr. Babbitt. (4) He kept thinking, \"Why did she leave? (5) Does she think my company is going to fail?\". (6) He also heard that Sanders got a big business deal, which made him worry even more. (7) Mr. Babbitt started to feel scared all the time. (8) He looked at his other employees and wondered if they might leave too. (9) He thought people were talking about him behind his back.\n\n (10) He wasn't invited to speak at a big dinner, and he wasn't asked to a friend's poker party. (11) He felt left out and worried that everyone was whispering about him. (12) When he went to the bank or was at work, he felt like people were watching and talking about him.\n\n (13) Mr. Babbitt started to imagine what people were saying about him. (14) He thought they were calling him dangerous because he liked to do things his own way. (15) It made him very nervous. (16) One day, he saw two people whispering, and it made his heart jump. (17) He walked past them feeling really awkward. (18) He saw two of his neighbors talking and felt they were talking about him too. (19) He went inside his house to avoid them. (20) Even though he was scared, Mr. Babbitt also felt stubborn. (21) Sometimes he felt proud of being bold and different. (22) Other times, he felt lost and wanted to go back to fitting in with everyone else. (23) But, he didn't want to give up his own ways. (24) At home, his wife noticed he was acting nervous. (25) She didn't understand why he didn't want to visit their friends. (26) Mr. Babbitt found it hard to explain what he was feeling. (27) He missed his friends Paul and Tanis, who weren't around anymore. (28) He felt lonely and said, \"The only real friend I have these days is Tinka,\" his child. (29) He spent a lot of time playing games with her. (30) He thought about visiting Paul, who was in prison, but it was too hard for him.

Montgomery\n\nParagraph: (1) Matthew was walking very quietly down the hallway. (2) He stopped in front of a door at the end of the hall. (3) He stood there for a little bit, gathering his courage. (4) Finally, he tapped lightly on the door and peeked inside.\n\n (5) Inside the room, Anne was sitting on a yellow chair near the window. (6) She was looking out into the garden and seemed very sad. (7) Matthew felt a tug at his heart when he saw her looking so unhappy. (8) He quietly closed the door behind him and tiptoed over to her.\n\n (9) \"Anne,\" he whispered softly, as if he didn't want anyone else to hear, \"how are you doing?\".\n\n (10) Anne gave him a small, tired smile.\n\n (11) \"I'm okay,\" she said quietly. (12) \"I use my imagination a lot, and that helps time go by. (13) It's a bit lonely, but I guess I have to get used to it.\".\n\n (14) Anne tried to smile again, showing she was strong, even though she felt alone.\n\n (15) Matthew remembered he had something important to say to Anne, and he needed to say it quickly before Marilla came back. (16) \"Anne, don't you think you should just go ahead and do it?\". (17) he whispered. (18) \"You'll have to do it sooner or later, and Marilla really wants you to. (19) Just get it over with.\". (20) \"Do you mean apologize to Mrs. (21) Lynde?\". (22) Anne asked. (23) \"Yes, apologize,\" Matthew said, nodding eagerly. (24) \"Just try to make things right. (25) That's what I meant.\". (26) \"I guess I could do it, to help you out,\" Anne said thoughtfully. (27) \"I really am sorry now. (28) I wasn't sorry last night; I was really upset. (29) But this morning, I wasn't mad anymore. (30) I felt awful about how I acted. (31) I was so embarrassed to think about apologizing to Mrs. Lynde. (32) I thought I'd never want to leave this room again. (33) But I would do anything for you if you really want me to.\".\n\n (34) Anne looked at Matthew, waiting to see what he would say next.

(2) He threatened that if he had a wife who annoyed him, he would hold her under a water pump!\n\n (3) Joe quickly said to leave her alone, but Orlick didn't listen.\n\n (4) My sister couldn't believe what she was hearing. (5) She got so upset that she started clapping her hands loudly and screaming. (6) She was very angry and even pulled her hair and threw her cap off!\n\n (7) Joe saw how upset everyone was getting, so he locked the door to keep everyone safe. (8) Then he asked Orlick why he was being so rude to his wife.\n\n (9) Orlick got ready to fight because he was also very angry. (10) They didn't even take off their work aprons before they started wrestling like two big giants.\n\n (11) Joe was much stronger, though. (12) Orlick ended up on the ground, covered in coal dust, and he didn't get up quickly.\n\n (13) After the fight, Joe picked up my sister because she had fainted. (14) They carried her inside to help her feel better, but she was still very upset and grabbed Joe’s hair.\n\n (15) Everything got quiet after the loud fight, like how Sundays are usually quiet and calm.\n\n (16) When I went downstairs later, I saw Joe and Orlick cleaning up. (17) Orlick got a small cut on his nose, but they were sharing a drink and not fighting anymore.\n\n (18) Joe said something funny to me about life having ups and downs as we walked outside.\n\n (19) Later, I went to Miss Havisham’s house again, but I was feeling nervous. (20) I walked by the gate many times before I decided to ring the bell.\n\n (21) Miss Sarah Pocket answered the gate. (22) Estella wasn't there.

(8) I think you're great, really great.”\n\n“Do a lot of guys bother you when you’re working?”\n\n\n\n“Oh, you wouldn’t believe it! (9) Some guys, just because I work in a barber shop, think they can say anything. (10) But I can handle them!

Montgomery\n\nParagraph: (1) “No, I can’t say I’m sorry,” said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, “no, not exactly sorry. (2) If you’ve finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she’ll lend me Diana’s apron pattern.”\n\n\n\n“Oh—it’s—it’s too dark,” cried Anne.\n\n (3) “Too dark? (4) Why, it’s only twilight. (5) And goodness knows you’ve gone over often enough after dark.”\n\n\n\n“I’ll go over early in the morning,” said Anne eagerly. (6) “I’ll get up at sunrise and go over, Marilla.”\n\n“What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? (7) I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening. (8) Go at once and be smart too.”\n\n“I’ll have to go around by the road, then,” said Anne, taking up her hat reluctantly.\n\n (9) “Go by the road and waste half an hour! (10) I’d like to catch you!”\n\n“I can’t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,” cried Anne desperately.\n\n (11) Marilla stared.\n\n (12) “The Haunted Wood! (13) Are you crazy? (14) What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood?”\n\n“The spruce wood over the brook,” said Anne in a whisper.\n\n (15) “Fiddlesticks! (16) There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. (17) Who has been telling you such stuff?”\n\n“Nobody,” confessed Anne. (18) “Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted. (19) All the places around here are so—so—commonplace. (20) We just got this up for our own amusement. (21) We began it in April. (22) A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla. (23) We chose the spruce grove because it’s so gloomy. (24) Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. (25) There’s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries. (26) She appears when there is to be a death in the family. (27) And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand—so. (28) Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. (29) And there’s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs. (30) Oh, Marilla, I wouldn’t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. (31) I’d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.”\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What would grab the speaker from behind the trees?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"28\": \"Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it.\",\n                \"29\": \"And there\\\"s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs.\",\n                \"30\": \"Oh, Marilla, I wouldn\\\"t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything.\",\n                \"31\": \"I\\\"d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.\\\"\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"31\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 31 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab the speaker.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"What does Marilla want Anne to ask Mrs. Barry?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"\\\"No, I can\\\"t say I\\\"m sorry,\\\" said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, \\\"no, not exactly sorry.\",\n                \"2\": \"If you\\\"ve finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she\\\"ll lend me Diana\\\"s apron pattern.\\\"\\\"Oh\\u2014it\\\"s\\u2014it\\\"s too dark,\\\" cried Anne.\",\n                \"3\": \"\\\"Too dark?\",\n                \"4\": \"Why, it\\\"s only twilight.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"2\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 2 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically details Marilla\\\"s request for Anne to ask Mrs. Barry if she can borrow Diana\\\"s apron pattern.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"Who wrings their hands by the brook?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"24\": \"Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things.\",\n                \"25\": \"There\\\"s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries.\",\n                \"26\": \"She appears when there is to be a death in the family.\",\n                \"27\": \"And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand\\u2014so.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"25\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 25 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically describes a \\\"white lady\\\" who walks along the brook wringing her hands and uttering wailing cries, matching the details asked in the question.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"When does Anne plan to go over to the place she mentioned?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"4\": \"Why, it\\\"s only twilight.\",\n                \"5\": \"And goodness knows you\\\"ve gone over often enough after dark.\\\"\\\"I\\\"ll go over early in the morning,\\\" said Anne eagerly.\",\n                \"6\": \"\\\"I\\\"ll get up at sunrise and go over, Marilla.\\\"\\\"What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley?\",\n                \"7\": \"I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"6\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 6 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions Anne\\\"s plan to go over at sunrise.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"Why was the spruce grove chosen for the setting?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"20\": \"We just got this up for our own amusement.\",\n                \"21\": \"We began it in April.\",\n                \"22\": \"A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla.\",\n                \"23\": \"We chose the spruce grove because it\\\"s so gloomy.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"23\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 23 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions the reason for choosing the spruce grove: because it\\\"s gloomy.

(7) It’s the first thing I ever saw that couldn’t be improved upon by imagination. (8) It just satisfies me here”—she put one hand on her breast—“it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. (9) Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?”\n\n\n\n“Well now, I just can’t recollect that I ever had.”\n\n\n\n“I have it lots of time—whenever I see anything royally beautiful. (10) But they shouldn’t call that lovely place the Avenue. (11) There is no meaning in a name like that. (12) They should call it—let me see—the White Way of Delight. (13) Isn’t that a nice imaginative name? (14) When I don’t like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so. (15) There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. (16) Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. (17) Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? (18) I’m glad and I’m sorry. (19) I’m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I’m always sorry when pleasant things end. (20) Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure. (21) And it’s so often the case that it isn’t pleasanter. (22) That has been my experience anyhow. (23) But I’m glad to think of getting home.

Montgomery\n\nParagraph: (1) \"Marilla, do you think I'll like these dresses?\". (2) Anne asked. (3) She stood in her room looking at three new dresses on her bed.\n\n (4) One dress was brown and made of a thick fabric that looked very strong. (5) Marilla had bought it from a traveling seller because it seemed like it would last a long time. (6) Another dress was checkered black and white, which Marilla found on sale during the winter. (7) The last one was blue and very plain, bought recently from a store nearby.\n\n (8) Marilla had made all the dresses the same way. (9) They had simple skirts attached to simple tops, and the sleeves were tight and plain too.\n\n (10) \"I'll try to like them,\" Anne said quietly.\n\n (11) \"I want you to really like them, not just pretend,\" Marilla replied, feeling a bit upset. (12) \"What's wrong with them? (13) They're new and clean, aren't they?\". (14) \"Yes, they're new and clean,\" Anne answered.\n\n (15) \"So why don't you like them?\". (16) Marilla asked. (17) \"They're not very pretty,\" Anne said slowly.\n\n (18) \"Pretty!\". (19) Marilla was surprised. (20) \"I didn't worry about making them pretty. (21) I believe it's better to have practical and sturdy dresses. (22) These dresses will be good for you. (23) The brown and the blue ones you can wear to school, and the checkered one is for church. (24) You should be happy to have them, especially after wearing those old thin dresses for so long.\".\n\n (25) \"I am happy,\" Anne said quickly. (26) \"But I'd be even happier if just one dress had puffed sleeves. (27) Puffed sleeves are very popular now. (28) Wearing them would make me feel so special.\".

(2) It seemed like she didn't like them, and that made me start to dislike them too.\n\n (3) She won the card game, and it was my turn to deal the cards. (4) I made a mistake with the cards because I felt nervous, knowing she was watching me closely. (5) She called me clumsy, just like someone who isn't good at delicate tasks.\n\n (6) Miss Havisham noticed that the girl said mean things about me, but I didn't say anything back. (7) She asked me what I thought of her. (8) I was shy to speak, but Miss Havisham told me to whisper it. (9) So, I told her quietly that I thought the girl was very proud and very pretty, but also not very nice to me. (10) Miss Havisham kept asking if there was anything else. (11) I finally said I wished I could go home. (12) She asked if I didn't want to see the girl again, even though she was pretty. (13) I wasn't sure, but I really wanted to go home at that moment.\n\n (14) Miss Havisham promised I could go home soon but asked me to finish the game first.\n\n (15) During the game, Miss Havisham looked very serious and never smiled. (16) She seemed very sad and tired. (17) The game ended with Estella winning everything. (18) She threw down the cards like she didn't care about winning from me.\n\n (19) Miss Havisham then wondered when I would come back. (20) She decided I should come back in six days, even though I started to say what day it was. (21) But she didn't want to hear about what day it was.\n\n (22) She told Estella to take me downstairs, give me something to eat, and let me look around.\n\n (23) I followed Estella with the candle down the stairs. (24) For a moment, the daylight surprised me because I thought it was still nighttime.\n\n (25) Estella told me to wait in the courtyard and then she left. (26) I was alone, so I looked at my hands and my boots. (27) I started to feel bad about them and wished they were nicer.\n\n (28) I thought about Joe, who had raised me, and wished we knew more about fancy things.

(2) said one of the prisoners, wiping away blood from his face with his torn sleeve. (3) \"I caught him! (4) I turned him over to you! (5) Remember that!\". (6) The officer replied, \"It doesn't really matter much. (7) It won't help you much, being in trouble yourself. (8) Put the handcuffs on!\". (9) \"I don't think it will help me. (10) I don't need it to,\" the prisoner said with a rough laugh. (11) \"I caught him. (12) He knows it. (13) That's good enough for me.\". (14) The other prisoner looked really hurt and was so bruised he could barely breathe. (15) He had to lean on a soldier to keep from falling down.\n\n (16) \"Listen, guard, he tried to kill me,\" he finally said.\n\n (17) \"Tried to kill him?\". (18) the first prisoner sneered. (19) \"Just tried? (20) I caught him and handed him over. (21) That's what I did. (22) I stopped him from escaping and dragged him back here.\".\n\n (23) The hurt prisoner gasped, \"He tried—to—murder me. (24) Remember that.\". (25) \"Look here,\" the first prisoner told the officer. (26) \"I escaped from the prison ship all by myself. (27) I found out he was here, and I couldn't let him get away or use me again. (28) No way. (29) If I had fallen, I would have grabbed him so tight, you'd still find him in my hold.\".\n\n (30) The scared prisoner said, \"He tried to murder me. (31) I would have been dead if you hadn't come.\". (32) \"He's lying!\". (33) the first prisoner shouted. (34) \"He's always been a liar. (35) Just look at his face—can't you see it? (36) Let him look at me. (37) I dare him.\". (38) The scared prisoner tried to smile but couldn't really hide his fear. (39) He looked around— at the soldiers, the marshes, the sky—but he wouldn't look at the first prisoner.\n\n (40) \"Do you see him?\". (41) the first prisoner continued. (42) \"Do you see how bad he is? (43) Look at his shifty eyes. (44) That's how he stared during our trial. (45) He never looked at me.\". (46) Finally, the scared prisoner glanced at the first one with a weak smile and said, \"You're not much to look at,\" glancing at his tied hands.\n\n (47) The first prisoner was so angry, he might have attacked if the soldiers hadn't stopped him. (48) The other prisoner then said, \"Didn't I tell you? (49) He'd kill me if he could!\". (50) He was shaking with fear, and his lips turned white like he was really scared.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What was the reaction of the

(2) The wind made strange, sad sounds, and the whole place felt spooky. (3) I thought about turning back, but I knew the area well, so I kept going even though I didn't really want to.\n\n (4) I wasn't heading towards my old house or following the path where some escaped prisoners had run. (5) Instead, I walked away from the large ships docked in the distance. (6) Although I could still see their lights, they were behind me.\n\n (7) I passed through some gates and had to wait for some cattle to move out of my path. (8) They were resting, but they got up and wandered off when I came by. (9) Soon, it seemed like I had the whole wide, open space to myself.\n\n (10) After a bit, I came near a place where lime was being made. (11) The air smelled sharp and heavy. (12) No one was working there, but I could see that they had left their tools around. (13) A stone quarry was right on my path, and it looked like workers had just left.\n\n (14) As I walked on, I saw a light in an old water control house. (15) Curious, I sped up and knocked on the door. (16) No one answered, so I knocked again and tried the handle. (17) The door opened easily. (18) Inside, there was a candle burning on a table, and a simple bed in the corner. (19) It looked like someone had just been there. (20) I called out, “Is anyone here?” but got no reply. (21) I checked my watch; it was past nine at night. (22) I called out once more, but still, no one answered.\n\n (23) It started to rain hard. (24) I stepped back inside to stay dry and thought about the candle. (25) If it was still lit, someone had to be coming back soon. (26) As I reached to check the candle, suddenly everything went dark, and I felt something tight around my neck. (27) It was a rope!
