(2) said Huldah Meserve, popping her head in through the door. (3) \"Can you take a break and show me around your room? (4) I just got these new gloves from the store. (5) I didn't want to wear mittens this winter; they feel too old-fashioned. (6) Since it's your first year here and you're younger than me, you might not think about these things, but I like to look stylish. (7) Wow, your room is so pretty! (8) I think it's the nicest one here! (9) Is it the curtains, or that lovely screen, or maybe Rebecca's lamp that makes it look so special? (10) You guys are really good at decorating. (11) I like my room to be pretty too, but I'm always so busy I hardly have time to tidy it up. (12) I usually don't make my bed until noon! (13) But since only our friends come over, it doesn't really matter much. (14) When I finish school, I'm going to decorate our living room at home and make it look amazing. (15) I've started learning some crafty decorating, and I'm going to add lots of cool things once I learn more.\n\n (16) Can I warm my feet by your heater? (17) I don't like wearing boots that cover my feet completely unless it's really muddy. (18) They make your feet look so big. (19) I had a hard time finding these boots with little heels, and I don't want to ruin them by wearing them in mud too often. (20) I think boys notice shoes a lot. (21) Yesterday, Elmer Webster stepped on my foot by accident and said sorry later. (22) He joked that my foot was so small he didn't even see it! (23) Isn't that funny? (24) Well, I do wear small shoes, and these heels make them look even smaller. (25) They say having a high arch is pretty, and even though I used to worry about mine, now I think it's nice.

Porter\n\nParagraph: (1) Nancy had to go tell Mr. John Pendleton some important news from Dr. Mead. (2) Miss Polly had promised Mr. Pendleton he'd hear news directly from them. (3) So, Miss Polly asked Nancy to go because she couldn't go herself.\n\n (4) Nancy used to dream about visiting the big old house where Mr. Pendleton lived. (5) It was full of secrets and known as the House of Mystery. (6) But today, Nancy was too sad to be excited. (7) When Mr. Pendleton saw Nancy, he looked very surprised. (8) He didn't expect her to visit him. (9) \"I'm Nancy, sir,\" she said politely. (10) \"Miss Harrington sent me to tell you about Miss Pollyanna.\".\n\n (11) \"Well?\". (12) Mr. Pendleton asked quickly. (13) He sounded a bit sharp, but Nancy knew he was really worried.\n\n (14) \"It ain't well, Mr. Pendleton,\" Nancy answered, her voice shaky.\n\n (15) \"You don't meanâ€”\" Mr. Pendleton couldn't finish his question. (16) He looked very scared. (17) \"Yes, sir,\" Nancy nodded sadly. (18) \"She can't walk again. (19) Never.\". (20) The room was very quiet for a little while. (21) Then Mr. Pendleton spoke, and his voice was full of sadness.\n\n (22) \"Poor little girl! (23) Poor little girl!\". (24) Nancy looked at him. (25) She was surprised. (26) Mr. Pendleton usually seemed grumpy, but now he looked very sad.\n\n (27) \"It seems so cruel,\" Mr. Pendleton said quietly. (28) \"She'll never dance in the sunshine again. (29) My little prism girl!\". (30) They were quiet again. (31) Then Mr. Pendleton suddenly asked, \"She doesn't know yet, right?\".\n\n (32) \"But she does, sir,\" Nancy replied, starting to cry. (33) \"And that's what makes it even harder. (34) She found out by accident.\". (35) Mr. Pendleton was shocked. (36) \"How did she find out?\". (37) he asked gently. (38) Nancy wiped her tears. (39) \"The cat, sir. (40) It pushed the door open, and Miss Pollyanna overheard them talking. (41) She learned about it that way.\". (42) Mr. Pendleton looked very sad as Nancy told him everything.

(2) This was not the first time he felt this way because of her. (3) She wouldn't look at him or say anything. (4) \"I was thinking about going to Quallingham,\" Lydgate said sadly. (5) \"It would have been hard, but maybe it would have helped. (6) But it seems like nothing I think of works. (7) You seem to say yes, but then you don't really agree. (8) If you don't want to do what I wish, just tell me. (9) Then I'll know what's going on.\". (10) Rosamond was very quiet. (11) A tear rolled down her cheek. (12) She was really unhappy with Lydgate. (13) She felt that everyone was being mean, even her father. (14) She thought everyone only cared about themselves.\n\n (15) Lydgate looked at her and felt very helpless. (16) He hated feeling this way. (17) It made him question if he was right or wrong. (18) \"Rosamond,\" he tried again, \"we need to be open and trust each other. (19) You often agree with me, but then you do something else. (20) I never know what to expect. (21) We could fix things if you admit this. (22) Am I really so bad? (23) Why can't you be honest with me?\". (24) She stayed quiet. (25) Lydgate kept trying. (26) \"Can't you say you made a mistake and will not go behind my back anymore?\". (27) he asked, sounding a bit hopeful. (28) Rosamond finally spoke, but she was upset. (29) \"I won't make promises when you've been so harsh. (30) You've said things like 'secret meddling' and 'false assent.' (31) I don't talk to you like that. (32) I think you should say sorry. (33) You said it's impossible to live with me. (34) You haven't made my life happy recently. (35) It's normal that I try to make things a bit easier for myself.\".

(2) One day, a playful puppy named Fido saw her smiling. (3) Fido thought Raggedy Ann wanted to play. (4) So, he started doing funny tricks to make her laugh.\n\n (5) As Fido played, he grabbed the end of Raggedy Ann's dress. (6) He tugged and pulled her around. (7) It looked like a game, but Raggedy Ann wasn't having fun. (8) She tried to get away, but Fido thought she was playing along. \n\n(9) Fido took Raggedy Ann out of the garden. (10) They went down a path and across a meadow. (11) Sometimes, Fido stopped and shook Raggedy Ann. (12) Her head would hit the ground with a \"ratty-tat-tat\" sound. (13) Then Fido would toss her into the air. (14) Raggedy Ann would flip over a few times before landing.\n\n (15) During their game, Raggedy Ann lost her apron. (16) Some of her yarn hair started to come loose too. (17) Soon, they came near a brook. (18) Another puppy saw them and ran over the foot-bridge to greet them. (19) \"What have you there, Fido?\". (20) asked the new puppy. (21) \"This is Raggedy Ann,\" Fido replied. (22) \"We are having fun playing.\". (23) The new puppy didn't know Raggedy Ann wasn't really having fun. (24) Fido really believed she liked being tossed and turned.\n\n (25) But the wild game did not last much longer. (26) When Raggedy Ann landed on the ground again, the new puppy grabbed her dress.

(2) She told her guest that they hardly ever got sick in her house. (3) She believed that because she taught her kids to dress warmly and not eat too much, they stayed healthy. (4) Eating too much, she said, was why people often needed doctors.\n\n (5) Dr. Lydgate, the guest, talked about kids who had parents who ate too much. (6) But Mrs. Farebrother thought it was simple - if you do wrong, it's because of you, not your parents.\n\n (7) \"My mother doesn't like confusing ideas,\" said the Vicar, her son.\n\n (8) \"I like simple truths,\" Mrs. Farebrother said. (9) \"When I was young, we knew what was right and wrong just from our lessons at church.\".\n\n (10) \"Nowadays,\" she continued, \"even if you quote the Prayer-book, someone might disagree!\".\n\n (11) \"That must make discussions interesting for those who like to argue,\" Dr. Lydgate commented.\n\n (12) \"But my mother usually agrees in the end,\" the Vicar added with a wink.\n\n (13) \"No, Camden, that's not right,\" Mrs. Farebrother corrected. (14) \"I stick to what my parents taught me. (15) Changing your mind too much isn't good.\". (16) Dr. Lydgate smiled. (17) \"Maybe someone might find a reason to change once.\".\n\n (18) \"But if you start changing for every new argument, where does it end?\". (19) she replied. (20) \"My father was consistent and a good man without needing fancy arguments.\".\n\n (21) \"If arguments made good people, then reading a cookbook should make a good dinner,\" she joked.\n\n (22) \"True, especially about dinner,\" her son agreed.\n\n (23) Mrs. Farebrother was firm in her beliefs. (24) She didn't care for new ideas which, to her, were like poorly made clothes that wouldn't last.\n\n (25) \"In my days, you knew a churchman was respectable,\" she said. (26) \"Now, it's hard to tell.

(12) When he found out, he was very surprised. (13) He decided to tell his uncle everything and stop hiding the secret.\n\n (14) Emma started to pay more attention. (15) Mrs. Weston said he would write a letter soon. (16) He promised to explain everything in the letter. (17) Mrs. Weston asked Emma to wait for the letter and not judge him too quickly. (18) She believed there might be good reasons for his actions.\n\n (19) Emma wasn't so sure. (20) She didn't think he suffered much from keeping secrets. (21) Then, she asked Mrs. Weston how Mr. Churchill reacted to all of this.\".\n\n (22) This rewrite simplifies the complex relationships and moral discussions in the original text to a level suitable

(2) He said, 'I knew you would like it. (3) When we have parties, we need a lot of people. (4) You can never have too many guests at a party! (5) And she's really nice, we couldn't leave her out.'\"\n\n (6) Emma didn't say anything. (7) But she didn't agree with him either. (8) It was now June, and the weather was great. (9) Mrs. Elton couldn't wait to set a date for their big party. (10) She wanted to talk to Mr. Weston about the food, like pigeon pies and cold lamb. (11) But then, one of the carriage horses got hurt. (12) This meant they had to wait. (13) They didn't know how long. (14) It could be days or weeks! (15) They couldn't plan anything. (16) Mrs. Elton was very upset. (17) \"This is so annoying!\". (18) she said to Mr. Knightley. (19) \"It's perfect weather to go out. (20) We had such a fun trip last year at this time.\". (21) Mr. Knightley had an idea. (22) \"Why don't you come to Donwell?\". (23) he said. (24) \"We don't need horses to go there. (25) You can come over and eat my strawberries. (26) They're almost ready.\". (27) Mr. Knightley was half-joking at first, but then he saw how excited she got. (28) \"Oh, I'd love to!\". (29) she said. (30) Donwell was known for its strawberries. (31) That was why he invited her. (32) But he didn't really need a reason. (33) She just liked to go places. (34) She told him she would visit many times. (35) She was very happy he invited her. (36) \"You can count on me,\" she said. (37) \"Just tell me when, and I'll be there. (38) Can I bring Jane Fairfax too?\". (39) \"I can't set a day yet,\" he told her. (40) \"I need to talk to some other friends I want to invite.\".\n\n (41) \"Don't worry about that,\" she said. (42) \"Let me handle it. (43) It's my party after all.

(2) The mom decided it was time to paint the walls and change the wallpaper. (3) Because of this, all the toys had to be moved. (4) The dolls ended up on a high shelf in a big jumble.\n\n (5) That same day, the little girl who owned the dolls wanted to put them to bed. (6) But her mom said it was better to keep the beds in the closet. (7) The painters were coming back early the next day. (8) So the dolls' beds were stacked up in the closet, and the dolls stayed on the shelf.\n\n (9) When night came and the house was quiet, Raggedy Ann, a doll at the bottom of the pile, spoke softly. (10) She asked if the other dolls could move a little. (11) Raggedy Ann felt squished. (12) \"The cotton in my body is getting as flat as a pancake!\". (13) she said with a smile. (14) Even though a tin soldier's foot was pressing on her face, Raggedy Ann kept smiling. (15) Hearing her, the dolls began to shift around on the shelf. (16) Soon, Raggedy Ann had enough space to sit up. (17) \"Oh, that feels so much better!\". (18) Raggedy Ann exclaimed. (19) She stretched her arms and legs.

(2) They were talking about a woman Will had met only once before.\n\n (3) \"No, no,\" said Naumann, noticing Will looked a bit worried.\n\n (4) \"Do you know the woman?\". (5) Naumann asked. (6) \"Yes, she's married to my cousin,\" replied Will, looking a bit distracted.\n\n (7) \"She's your cousin's wife? (8) I thought he looked more like an uncle,\" Naumann joked.\n\n (9) \"He's not my uncle, he's my second cousin,\" Will corrected him, sounding a bit annoyed.\n\n (10) \"Okay, okay. (11) Don't be upset. (12) Do you mind if I think she looks like a perfect young Madonna?\". (13) Naumann asked. (14) \"I'm not mad. (15) I only saw her once, right before I left England,\" Will explained. (16) \"They weren't married then. (17) I didn't know they would be in Rome.\". (18) \"But now you will visit them, right? (19) Find their address since you know the name,\" Naumann suggested.\n\n (20) \"I don't know what I'll do,\" Will said, unsure.\n\n (21) Naumann laughed, \"If you were an artist like me, you'd think of her as a beautiful subject for a painting.\".\n\n (22) Will didn't agree. (23) \"I don't think the whole universe is about your paintings.\".\n\n (24) Naumann put his hand on Will's shoulder, smiling. (25) \"My job is to paint. (26) And I think your cousin's wife would make a great picture!\".\n\n (27) \"What if I don't want you to paint her?\". (28) Will asked. (29) \"It doesn't matter. (30) It's all about creating art, whether it happens or not,\" Naumann explained.\n\n (31) Will laughed, despite his frustration.\n\n (32) \"So, will you help me meet her?\". (33) Naumann asked hopefully. (34) \"No, Naumann! (35) English ladies aren't just models for everyone.

(2) I found lots of eggs inside it. (3) It was the yummiest meat I've had since I came here. (4) I've only had chicken and goat meat before. (5) June 18 - It rained all day, so I stayed inside. (6) It was cold and I felt chilly, which was strange because it's usually warm here.\n\n (7) June 19 - I felt really sick today. (8) I was shivering as if it was very cold. (9) June 20 - I couldn't sleep last night. (10) My head hurt a lot and I felt hot. (11) June 21 - I was very sick and scared because I was alone. (12) For the first time since the big storm, I prayed to God. (13) My mind was all mixed up. (14) June 22 - I felt a little better, but I was still scared of being sick.\n\n (15) June 23 - I felt very sick again. (16) I was cold, then I shivered, and then my head hurt a lot.\n\n (17) June 24 - Today, I felt much better.\n\n (18) June 25 - I had a bad fever that lasted seven hours. (19) First, I was cold, then hot, and then I started sweating a little.\n\n (20) June 26 - I felt better, but I was very hungry. (21) I used my gun to hunt. (22) I was weak but I managed to catch a goat. (23) I cooked some meat by roasting it. (24) I wished I could make soup, but I didn't have a pot.\n\n (25) June 27 - I was very sick again, so I stayed in bed all day. (26) I couldn't eat or drink. (27) I was so thirsty, but too weak to get water. (28) I prayed to God. (29) I was confused and just kept saying, \"Lord, help me!\". (30) I fell asleep and woke up late at night feeling a little better but still very weak and thirsty. (31) I had no water, so I had to wait until morning. (32) June 28 - I slept again and had a scary dream. (33) I dreamed I was outside, and a man came down from the sky in a bright flame. (34) He looked scary and the ground shook when he landed. (35) He came towards me with a spear, wanting to hurt me. (36) He stood on a hill and said scary things to me. (37) He raised his spear as if to strike me.\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did he do on the hill?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n

Porter\n\nParagraph: (1) In the town, people were talking and even crying. (2) Both women and men shared their feelings about the sad news. (3) They talked by the fences, in stores, and on the streets. (4) They were all upset about Pollyanna, a sweet little girl who was hurt. (5) Pollyanna used to play a happy game, finding something good in everything. (6) But now, she felt too sad to play her game. (7) In her house, Pollyanna's aunt, Miss Polly, started getting many visitors. (8) People came to see how Pollyanna was doing. (9) There were friends, neighbors, and even some people they didn't know well. (10) Kids came too. (11) Everyone cared a lot about Pollyanna. (12) Some visitors stayed a little while. (13) Some just stood outside, looking unsure. (14) People brought gifts like books, flowers, or tasty treats. (15) Some visitors cried openly. (16) Others tried to hide their tears. (17) But everyone wanted to know how Pollyanna was and they all had kind words for her.\n\n (18) Among those who came was Mr. John Pendleton. (19) Usually, he needed crutches to walk, but today he didn't bring them. (20) He looked very serious and upset. (21) \"I can't even say how shocked I am,\" Mr. Pendleton said. (22) He hoped there was something that could be done to help Pollyanna.\n\n (23) Miss Polly felt very sad and hopeless. (24) \"The doctors are trying their best,\" she explained. (25) \"They have given her treatments and medicine. (26) But they don't think they will help much.\". (27) Everyone in town wanted to do something for Pollyanna.

(2) She had a lot of fun there. (3) The next day, she remembered all the good times she had. (4) Emma made the Coles very happy. (5) They liked having her around. (6) And everyone was still talking about her after she left.\n\n (7) Emma thought about her visit. (8) She was happy, but she had a couple of worries. (9) She thought maybe she shouldn't have shared her guesses about Jane Fairfax's feelings with Frank Churchill. (10) Emma wondered if she should have kept quiet. (11) Emma also felt a bit sad about her piano playing. (12) She knew she wasn't as good as Jane Fairfax. (13) This made her practice really hard for a long time.\n\n (14) While she was practicing, her friend Harriet came in. (15) Harriet started praising Emma's playing. (16) \"Oh! (17) if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\". (18) Harriet said. (19) \"Don't put us in the same group, Harriet. (20) My playing is much different from hers,\" Emma replied.\n\n (21) \"Oh! (22) dearâ€”I think you play the best of the two. (23) I love listening to you play,\" said Harriet. (24) \"People who know about music can tell the difference,\" Emma explained. (25) \"I'm okay, but Jane is much better.\". (26) \"But I still think you're just as good,\" Harriet insisted. (27) \"Mr. Cole and Mr. Frank Churchill also said you have great taste in music.\".\n\n (28) \"Ah, but Jane Fairfax is good at both taste and how she plays,\" Emma said. \n\n(29) Emma appreciated Harriet's kind words, but she knew Jane was really good at playing piano.

(2) She said, \"I've read lots of books. (3) Books from school, from the Sunday-school, and even my dad's books.\". (4) She listed many books she had read, like \"The Lamplighter\" and \"David Copperfield.\".\n\n (5) Mr. Cobb replied, \"I haven't read those books, but I've read a lot in my days. (6) Now, I mostly read the Almanac and the Weekly Argus.\".\n\n (7) As they talked, they were getting closer to Riverboro. (8) Mr. Cobb pointed out, \"There's the river again. (9) We're almost there. (10) We'll see Riverboro soon. (11) It's not far. (12) I live just a bit beyond your aunt's house.\". (13) Rebecca felt a bit nervous and moved in her seat. (14) \"I didn't think I'd be scared,\" she whispered, \"but I guess I am, just a little.\".\n\n (15) Mr. Cobb asked her, \"Would you want to go back?\".\n\n (16) Rebecca looked at him bravely and said, \"I'd never go back. (17) I might be scared, but I wouldn't run away. (18) Going to Aunt Mirandyâ€™s is scary like going into a dark basement. (19) There might be scary things, but there could also be fairies and enchanted frogs!\".\n\n (20) She then asked, \"Is there a main street in the village, like in Wareham?\".\n\n (21) Mr. Cobb replied, \"Well, it's sort of a main street. (22) Your Aunt Sawyer lives on it. (23) But there are no shops or mills. (24) It's a very small village. (25) You need to cross the river to see anything exciting.\".\n\n (26) Rebecca sighed, \"I'm almost sorry. (27) I imagined driving down a busy main street, sitting up high in this carriage. (28) It would be wonderful, like being in a parade. (29) I remember last summer when the circus came to town. (30) They had a parade with horses, clowns, and even a snake charmer in a tiny chariot. (31) She looked so magical. (32) It made you feel all shivery inside. (33) Have you ever felt that way when you saw something amazing, Mr. (34) Cobb?\". (35) Mr. Cobb smiled as he listened to Rebecca's vivid memories and her dreams about their arrival. (36) They continued their journey, nearing Rebecca's new home with every clip-clop of the horses' hooves.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who smiled

Porter\n\nParagraph: (1) Last week, Dr. Mead finally came to visit. (2) He was very tall and looked strong. (3) His eyes were kind and gray, and he always had a smile. (4) Pollyanna really liked him and she told him right away.\n\n (5) \"You remind me of my doctor,\" she told him with a smile.\n\n (6) \"Your doctor?\". (7) asked Dr. Mead, looking surprised. (8) Dr. Warren, who was nearby, was much shorter and had brown eyes and a pointy beard.\n\n (9) \"Oh, Dr. Warren isn't my doctor,\" explained Pollyanna quickly. (10) \"He's my Aunt Polly's doctor. (11) My doctor is Dr. (12) Chilton.\". (13) \"Oh,\" said Dr. Mead, looking a little confused.\n\n (14) Pollyanna noticed her aunt looked embarrassed and turned away.\n\n (15) \"You see, I really wanted Dr. Chilton to come,\" Pollyanna continued, \"but Aunt Polly chose you because she thinks you know more about fixing broken legs like mine.\".\n\n (16) \"Do you know more?\". (17) Pollyanna asked curiously. (18) Dr. Mead didn't answer right away. (19) \"We'll see in time,\" he said kindly. (20) Just then, Dr. Warren came over to talk to them.\n\n (21) The cat, Fluffy, was about to cause a bit of trouble. (22) She pushed against Pollyanna's door until it opened a bit. (23) If that hadn't happened, Pollyanna wouldn't have heard something important.\n\n (24) In the hall, the two doctors, a nurse, and Miss Polly were talking. (25) In Pollyanna's room, Fluffy jumped onto the bed and meowed happily.

(3) Mr. Brooke asked. (4) He didn't look surprised. (5) \"I've known Mr. Casaubon for ten years. (6) He's a very smart man. (7) He might even become a bishop someday!\".

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r08von069m0736pcf5aebu", "global_key": "226d3_2_5", "row_data": "Grade level: 2 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\n\nBook Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin\n\nParagraph: (1) The day before Rebecca left for her trip to the South with Miss Maxwell, she was in the library with her friends, Emma Jane and Huldah. (2) They were looking through big books to find some information.\n\n (3) Before they left the library, they walked by some locked bookcases. (4) These bookcases were filled with storybooks that were only for teachers and local people to read, not for students like them. (5) But the friends loved to peek through the glass and look at the book titles.\n\n (6) Rebecca saw a new book in the corner. (7) She read the title out loud and smiled. (8) \"The Rose of Joy. (9) Listen, girls; doesn't that sound pretty? (10) The Rose of Joy. (11) It looks wonderful too. (12) I wonder what it means?\". (13) Huldah thought for a moment and said, \"I think everyoneâ€™s 'Rose of Joy' might be different. (14) For me, it would be living in a big city with lots of money to spend and pretty clothes. (15) And I'd be around fancy people all the time.\". (16) \"That would be fun,\" Emma Jane agreed. (17) \"But would that really be joy, or just fun? (18) Oh, I just had an idea!\". (19) \"Don't scare me like that!\". (20) Huldah jumped. (21) \"I thought you saw a mouse.\". (22) \"Sorry,\" Emma Jane giggled. (23) \"I donâ€™t get ideas very often. (24) But this one hit me like lightning. (25) Rebecca, what if 'The Rose of Joy' is all about success?\".\n\n (26) \"Thatâ€™s a nice thought,\" Rebecca said, thinking hard. (27) \"Success would bring joy, but it doesnâ€™t quite feel like a rose. (28) Maybe it could be love?\". (29) \"I wish we could read that book!\". (30) Emma Jane sighed. (31) \"But hearing you say 'love' makes me think that might be the right answer.\".\n\n (32) Rebecca kept thinking about those words all day.

(2) She looked quickly and then looked away. (3) \"Paris is the capital of France,\" she told him. (4) \"You can get there by boat. (5) It's in my geography book.\". (6) She smiled as she talked about what she learned. (7) \"The book says French people like to dance and are very polite. (8) They also like 'light wines,' which might be like cider or ginger pop.\".\n\n (9) Rebecca liked to imagine Paris. (10) \"I can see it when I close my eyes,\" she said. (11) \"There are beautiful ladies with pink sunshades and beaded purses. (12) The gentlemen are nice and drink ginger pop while they dance.\".\n\n (13) \"But we see Milltown all the time,\" Rebecca sighed.\n\n (14) Mr. Cobb wasn't impressed by big cities. (15) \"Milltown isnâ€™t much,\" he said, like he'd seen every city there was.\n\n (16) \"Watch this!\". (17) he then said. (18) He threw a newspaper perfectly onto Mrs. Brown's doorstep. (19) It landed right on the mat. (20) \"Wow!\". (21) Rebecca exclaimed. (22) \"You threw it just like a circus knife thrower!\".\n\n (23) \"I wish there were lots of houses in a row,\" she dreamed out loud. (24) \"Each one could have a mat and a door, and I could throw a newspaper on each.\".\n\n (25) Mr. Cobb laughed. (26) \"I might miss some,\" he admitted. (27) \"If your aunt Mirandy says itâ€™s okay, I'll take you to Milltown this summer,\" he offered, if there was space in the stagecoach.\n\n (28) Rebecca was so excited. (29) It felt like a dream to think she might visit Milltown. (30) \"It's like having a fairy godmother!\". (31) she exclaimed. (32) \"Have you ever read 'Cinderella' or 'The Yellow Dwarf'?\". (33) she asked Mr. Cobb. (34) Mr. Cobb thought for a bit. (35) \"No, I canâ€™t say I have,\" he answered. (36) \"Where do you get to read so many stories?\".

(2) \"Is it about Tertius?\". (3) she asked. (4) She felt worried because something didn't make sense to her.\n\n (5) \"Oh dear,\" her dad said. (6) \"You married into some tough times. (7) Not only debts but even worse things.\". (8) \"Wait, Lucy,\" Mr. Vincy said. (9) \"Rosamond, did you hear anything about your uncle Bulstrode?\".\n\n (10) \"No, papa,\" Rosamond replied, feeling very scared. (11) It was like an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, making her feel weak.\n\n (12) Her dad decided to tell her everything. (13) \"It's better you know, my dear. (14) I think Lydgate, your husband, might have to leave town. (15) Things haven't gone well for him. (16) I don't think it's his fault, though.\". (17) This news really upset Rosamond. (18) She thought no one could have it as tough as she did now. (19) She believed marrying Lydgate was going to be wonderful, but now it felt like a mistake. (20) She didnâ€™t tell her parents much about how she felt and only said that Lydgate should have left town earlier.\n\n (21) Her mom noticed how strong Rosamond was being. (22) \"She's handling it so well,\" her mom said. (23) \"Thank God,\" said Mr. Vincy, feeling very sad.\n\n (24) Rosamond felt really upset with Lydgate. (25) She wondered what he had actually done. (26) Why hadnâ€™t he told her everything? (27) He didn't talk about it, and she felt she couldnâ€™t ask him.\n\n (28) She thought about asking her dad if she could move back home. (29) But that idea felt too sad. (30) She couldnâ€™t imagine being a married woman living with her parents again. (31) It just didn't feel right to her. (32) A couple of days passed, and Lydgate noticed Rosamond was acting differently. (33) He wondered if she would talk to him about the bad news. (34) The silence between them was very hard for him. (35) He knew he should have shared everything with her, but now it was even harder to break the silence.\n\n (36) Both felt very alone, even though they were together.

(10) \"I think you must be mistaken. (11) I don't remember writing about that.\". (12) Frank insisted, \"You must remember! (13) Mrs. Perry was so happy about it. (14) She thought it would keep Mr. Perry warm and dry in bad weather.\".\n\n (15) Mrs. Weston was still confused. (16) \"I really donâ€™t recall such a plan.\". (17) Just then, Mr. Weston joined in the conversation. (18) \"A carriage for Perry? (19) That's great news! (20) Did he tell you himself?\". (21) Frank chuckled. (22) \"No, Dad. (23) It seems I was wrong. (24) I thought Mrs. Weston told me, but she didnâ€™t.\". (25) Mr. Weston laughed a little. (26) \"It's funny how dreams can seem so real, isn't it?\".\n\n (27) Frank agreed. (28) \"Yes, I must have dreamt it. (29) I often dream about folks back here when I'm away.\".\n\n (30) His father replied, \"Dreams can be so strange. (31) They make you think!\". (32) As they walked on, Mrs. Weston smiled.
