Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) I'll write 'em. (2) I'll write Mrs. White. (3) No, I'll write Mrs. Jones. (4) Mrs. White has got the most money, but Mrs. Jones gives the most—which is kind of funny, isn't it? (5) when you think of it. (6) But I reckon some of the Aiders will take you.”

“All right—but don't furgit ter say I'll work fur my board an' keep,” put in Jimmy. (7) “I ain't no beggar, an' biz'ness is biz'ness, even with Ladies' Aiders, I'm thinkin'.” He hesitated, then added: “An' I s'pose I better stay where I be fur a spell yet—till you hear.”



“Of course,” nodded Pollyanna emphatically. (8) “Then I'll know just where to find you. (9) And they'll take you—I'm sure you're far enough away for that. (10) Didn't Aunt Polly take—Say!” she broke off, suddenly, “DO you suppose I was Aunt Polly's little girl from India?”



“Well, if you ain't the queerest kid,” grinned Jimmy, as he turned away. (11) It was about a week after the accident in Pendleton Woods that Pollyanna said to her aunt one morning:



“Aunt Polly, please would you mind very much if I took Mrs. (12) Snow's calf's-foot jelly this week to some one else? (13) I'm sure Mrs. (14) Snow wouldn't—this once.”

“Dear me, Pollyanna, what ARE you up to now?” sighed her aunt. (15) “You ARE the most extraordinary child!”

Pollyanna frowned a little anxiously. (16) “Aunt Polly, please, what is extraordinary? (17) If you're EXtraordinary you can't be ORdinary, can you?”



“You certainly can not.”



“Oh, that's all right, then. (18) I'm glad I'm EXtraordinary,” sighed Pollyanna, her face clearing. (19) “You see, Mrs. White used to say Mrs. Rawson was a very ordinary woman—and she disliked Mrs. Rawson something awful. (20) They were always fight—I mean, father had—that is, I mean, WE had more trouble keeping peace between them than we did between any of the rest of the Aiders,” corrected Pollyanna, a little breathless from her efforts to steer between the Scylla of her father's past commands in regard to speaking of church quarrels, and the Charybdis of her aunt's present commands in regard to speaking of her father. (21) “Yes, yes; well, never mind,” interposed Aunt Polly, a trifle impatiently. (22) “You do run on so, Pollyanna, and no matter what we're talking about you always bring up at those Ladies' Aiders!”



“Yes'm,” smiled Pollyanna, cheerfully, “I reckon I do, maybe. (23) But you see they used to bring me up, and—”

“That will do, Pollyanna,” interrupted a cold voice. (24) “Now what is it about this jelly?”

“Nothing, Aunt Polly, truly, that you would mind, I'm sure. (25) You let me take jelly to HER, so I thought you would to HIM—this once. (26) You see, broken legs aren't like—like lifelong invalids, so his won't last forever as Mrs. (27) Snow's does, and she can have all the rest of the things after just once or twice.”



“'Him'? (28) 'He'? (29) 'Broken leg'? (30) What are you talking about, Pollyanna?”

Pollyanna stared; then her face relaxed. (31) “Oh, I forgot.

Book Title: Notes from the Underground

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long, deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing completely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he wanted. (2) This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my temper and flew at him in a fury. (3) I was irritated beyond endurance apart from him. (4) “Stay,” I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning, with one hand behind his back, to go to his room. (5) “Stay! (6) Come back, come back, I tell you!” and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned round and even looked at me with some wonder. (7) However, he persisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me. (8) “How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for? (9) Answer!”

After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round again. (10) “Stay!” I roared, running up to him, “don’t stir! (11) There. (12) Answer, now: what did you come in to look at?”

“If you have any order to give me it’s my duty to carry it out,” he answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another, all this with exasperating composure. (13) “That’s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!” I shouted, turning crimson with anger. (14) “I’ll tell you why you came here myself: you see, I don’t give you your wages, you are so proud you don’t want to bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid stares, to worry me and you have no sus-pic-ion how stupid it is—stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! (15) ...”

He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him. (16) “Listen,” I shouted to him. (17) “Here’s the money, do you see, here it is,” (I took it out of the table drawer); “here’s the seven roubles complete, but you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ... going ... to ... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon. (18) Do you hear?”

“That cannot be,” he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence. (19) “It shall be so,” I said, “I give you my word of honour, it shall be!”



“And there’s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,” he went on, as though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. (20) “Why, besides, you called me a ‘torturer,’ for which I can summon you at the police-station at any time for insulting behaviour.”



“Go, summon me,” I roared, “go at once, this very minute, this very second! (21) You are a torturer all the same! (22) a torturer!”

But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud calls to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without looking round. (23) “If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,” I decided inwardly. (24) Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating slowly and violently. (25) “Apollon,” I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, “go at once without a minute’s delay and fetch the police-officer.”



He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles and taken up some sewing. (26) But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw. (27) “At once, go this minute! (28) Go on, or else you can’t imagine what will happen.”



“You are certainly out of your mind,” he observed, without even raising his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle. (29) “Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) The young Cuzaks knew all about them. (2) ‘He made grandfather’s coffin, didn’t he?’ Anton asked. (3) ‘Wasn’t they good fellows, Jim?’ Ántonia’s eyes filled. (4) ‘To this day I’m ashamed because I quarrelled with Jake that way. (5) I was saucy and impertinent to him, Leo, like you are with people sometimes, and I wish somebody had made me behave.’



‘We aren’t through with you, yet,’ they warned me. (6) They produced a photograph taken just before I went away to college: a tall youth in striped trousers and a straw hat, trying to look easy and jaunty. (7) ‘Tell us, Mr. Burden,’ said Charley, ‘about the rattler you killed at the dog-town. (8) How long was he? (9) Sometimes mother says six feet and sometimes she says five.’



These children seemed to be upon very much the same terms with Ántonia as the Harling children had been so many years before. (10) They seemed to feel the same pride in her, and to look to her for stories and entertainment as we used to do. (11) It was eleven o’clock when I at last took my bag and some blankets and started for the barn with the boys. (12) Their mother came to the door with us, and we tarried for a moment to look out at the white slope of the corral and the two ponds asleep in the moonlight, and the long sweep of the pasture under the star-sprinkled sky. (13) The boys told me to choose my own place in the haymow, and I lay down before a big window, left open in warm weather, that looked out into the stars. (14) Ambrosch and Leo cuddled up in a hay-cave, back under the eaves, and lay giggling and whispering. (15) They tickled each other and tossed and tumbled in the hay; and then, all at once, as if they had been shot, they were still. (16) There was hardly a minute between giggles and bland slumber. (17) I lay awake for a long while, until the slow-moving moon passed my window on its way up the heavens. (18) I was thinking about Ántonia and her children; about Anna’s solicitude for her, Ambrosch’s grave affection, Leo’s jealous, animal little love. (19) That moment, when they all came tumbling out of the cave into the light, was a sight any man might have come far to see. (20) Ántonia had always been one to leave images in the mind that did not fade—that grew stronger with time. (21) In my memory there was a succession of such pictures, fixed there like the old woodcuts of one’s first primer: Ántonia kicking her bare legs against the sides of my pony when we came home in triumph with our snake; Ántonia in her black shawl and fur cap, as she stood by her father’s grave in the snowstorm; Ántonia coming in with her work-team along the evening sky-line. (22) She lent herself to immemorial human attitudes which we recognize by instinct as universal and true. (23) I had not been mistaken. (24) She was a battered woman now, not a lovely girl; but she still had that something which fires the imagination, could still stop one’s breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things. (25) She had only to stand in the orchard, to put her hand on a little crab tree and look up at the apples, to make you feel the goodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last. (26) All the strong things of her heart came out in her body, that had been so tireless in serving generous emotions. (27) It was no wonder that her sons stood tall and straight. (28) She was a rich mine of life, like the founders of early races.

Book Title: Mrs. Dalloway

Book Author: Virginia Woolf

Paragraph: (1) Then she forgot her sponge, and ran along the passage naked. (2) That grim old housemaid, Ellen Atkins, went about grumbling—“Suppose any of the gentlemen had seen?” Indeed she did shock people. (3) She was untidy, Papa said. (4) The strange thing, on looking back, was the purity, the integrity, of her feeling for Sally. (5) It was not like one’s feeling for a man. (6) It was completely disinterested, and besides, it had a quality which could only exist between women, between women just grown up. (7) It was protective, on her side; sprang from a sense of being in league together, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them (they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe), which led to this chivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side than Sally’s. (8) For in those days she was completely reckless; did the most idiotic things out of bravado; bicycled round the parapet on the terrace; smoked cigars. (9) Absurd, she was—very absurd.But the charm was overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot-water can in her hands and saying aloud, “She is beneath this roof.... She is beneath this roof!”



No, the words meant absolutely nothing to her now. (10) She could not even get an echo of her old emotion. (11) But she could remember going cold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy (now the old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her hairpins, laid them on the dressing-table, began to do her hair), with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and dressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall “if it were now to die ’twere now to be most happy.” That was her feeling—Othello’s feeling, and she felt it, she was convinced, as strongly as Shakespeare meant Othello to feel it, all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet Sally Seton! (12) She was wearing pink gauze—was that possible? (13) Sheseemed, anyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown in, attached itself for a moment to a bramble. (14) But nothing is so strange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?) (15) as the complete indifferenceof other people. (16) Aunt Helena just wandered off after dinner; Papa read the paper. (17) Peter Walsh might have been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and sang Brahms without any voice. (18) All this was only a background for Sally. (19) She stood by the fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted rather against his will (he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace), when suddenly she said, “What a shame to sit indoors!” and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down. (20) Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went on about Wagner. (21) She and Sally fell a little behind. (22) Then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it. (23) Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips. (24) The whole world might have turned upside down! (25) The others disappeared; there she was alone with Sally. (26) And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it—a diamond, somethinginfinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling! (27) when old Joseph and Peter faced them:

“Star-gazing?” said Peter. (28) It was like running one’s face against a granite wall in the darkness! (29) It was shocking; it was horrible! (30) Not for herself.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) The game had been suggested by an old alpenstock which had been thoughtlessly presented to William by a friend of Mr. Brown’s. (2) The paint of the staircase and upstairs corridor had been completely ruined before the family knew of the gift, and the alpenstock had been confiscated for a week, then restored on the condition that it was not to be brought into the house. (3) The result was the game of mountaineering up the plank. (4) They carried the alpenstock in turns, but William had two turns running to mark the fact that he was its proud possessor. (5) Mrs. Brown approached William on the subject of his prospectiverôleof page with a certain apprehension. (6) The normal attitude of William’s family towards William was one of apprehension. (7) “Would you like to go to Cousin Sybil’s wedding?” she said. (8) “No, I wu’nt,” said William without hesitation. (9) “Wouldn’t you like to go dressed up?” she said. (10) “Red Injun?” said William with a gleam of hope. (11) “Er—no, not exactly.”

“Pirate?”



“Not quite.”



“I’d go as a Red Injun, or I’d go as a Pirate,” he said firmly, “but I wu’nt go as anything else.”



“A page,” said Miss Grant’s clear, melodious voice, “is a mediæval and romantic idea, William. (12) There’s the glamour of chivalry about it that should appeal strongly to a boy of your age.”



William turned his inscrutable countenance upon her and gave her a cold glare. (13) They discussed his costume in private. (14) “I’ve got a pair of lovely white silk stockings,” said his mother.“They’d do for tights, and Ethel has got a satin petticoat that’s just beginning to go in one place. (15) I should think we could make some sort of costume from that, don’t you? (16) We’ll buy some more white satin and get some patterns.”



“No, I won’t wear Ethel’s ole clothes,” said William smouldering. (17) “You all jus’ want to make me look ridiclus. (18) You don’t care how ridiclus I look. (19) I shall be ridiclus all the rest of my life goin’ about in Ethel’s ole clothes. (20) I jus’ won’t do it. (21) I jus’ won’t go to any ole weddin’. (22) No, Idon’twant to see Cousin Sybil married, an’ I jus’won’tbe made look ridiclus in Ethel’s ole clothes.”



They reasoned and coaxed and threatened, but in vain. (23) Finally William yielded to parental authority and went about his world with an air of a martyr doomed to the stake. (24) Even the game of mountaineering had lost its charm and the alpenstock lay neglected against the garden wall. (25) The attitude of his select circle of friends was not encouraging. (26) “Yah!Page!Who’s goin’ to be apage? (27) Oh, crumbs. (28) A page all dressed up in white.Dearlittle Willie. (29) Won’t he look swe-e-e-et?”

Life became very full.

Book Title: Mrs. Dalloway

Book Author: Virginia Woolf

Paragraph: (1) who took wonderfully, they said, after old King Edward, but was ever so much slimmer. (2) The Prince lived at St. James’s; but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother. (3) So Sarah Bletchley said with her baby in her arms, tipping her foot up and down as though she were by her own fender in Pimlico, but keeping her eyes on the Mall, while Emily Coates ranged over the Palace windows and thought of the housemaids, the innumerable housemaids, the bedrooms, the innumerable bedrooms. (4) Joined by an elderly gentleman with an Aberdeen terrier, by men without occupation, the crowd increased. (5) Little Mr. Bowley, who had rooms in the Albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life but could be unsealed suddenly, inappropriately, sentimentally, by this sort of thing—poor women waiting to see the Queen go past—poor women, nice little children, orphans, widows, the War—tut-tut—actually had tears in his eyes. (6) A breeze flaunting ever so warmly down the Mall through the thin trees, past the bronze heroes, lifted some flag flying in the British breast of Mr. Bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the Mall and held it high as the car approached; and let the poor mothers of Pimlicopress close to him, and stood very upright. (7) The car came on. (8) Suddenly Mrs. Coates looked up into the sky. (9) The sound of an aeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd. (10) There it was coming over the trees, letting out white smoke from behind, which curled and twisted, actually writing something! (11) making letters in the sky! (12) Every one looked up. (13) Dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up, curved in a loop, raced, sank, rose, and whatever it did, wherever it went, out fluttered behind it a thick ruffled bar of white smoke which curled and wreathed upon the sky in letters. (14) But what letters? (15) A C was it? (16) an E, then an L? (17) Only for a moment did they lie still; then they moved and melted and were rubbed out up in the sky, and the aeroplane shot further away and again, in a fresh space of sky, began writing a K, an E, a Y perhaps? (18) “Glaxo,” said Mrs. Coates in a strained, awestricken voice, gazing straight up, and her baby, lying stiff and white in her arms, gazed straight up. (19) “Kreemo,” murmured Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep-walker. (20) With his hat held out perfectly still in his hand, Mr. Bowley gazed straight up. (21) All down the Mall people were standing and looking upinto the sky. (22) As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then another, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there among the gulls. (23) The aeroplane turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked, swiftly, freely, like a skater—



“That’s an E,” said Mrs. Bletchley— or a dancer—



“It’s toffee,” murmured Mr. Bowley— (and the car went in at the gates and nobody looked at it), and shutting off the smoke, away and away it rushed, and the smoke faded and assembled itself round the broad white shapes of the clouds. (24) It had gone; it was behind the clouds. (25) There was no sound. (26) The clouds to which the letters E, G, or L had attached themselves moved freely, as if destined to cross from West to East on a mission of the greatest importance which would never be revealed, and yet certainly so it was—a mission of the greatest importance. (27) Then suddenly, as a train comes out of a tunnel, the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds again, the sound boring into the ears of all people in the Mall, in the Green Park, in Piccadilly, in Regent Street, in Regent’s Park, and thebar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down, and it soared up and wrote one letter after another—but what word was it writing? (28) Lucrezia Warren Smith, sitting by her husband’s side on a seat in Regent’s Park in the Broad Walk, looked up. (29) “Look, look, Septimus!” she cried.

Book Title: Mrs. Dalloway

Book Author: Virginia Woolf

Paragraph: (1) The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he thought. (2) A patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind, and with it a rustling, regular thudding sound, which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts, strict in step, up Whitehall, without his doing. (3) Boys in uniform, carrying guns, marched with their eyes ahead of them, marched, their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England. (4) It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a very fine training. (5) But they did not look robust. (6) They were weedy for the most part, boys of sixteen, who might, to-morrow, stand behind bowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters. (7) Now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from Finsbury Pavement to the empty tomb. (8) They had taken their vow. (9) The traffic respected it; vans were stopped. (10) I can’t keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up Whitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every one, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly,and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline. (11) One had to respect it; one might laugh; but one had to respect it, he thought. (12) There they go, thought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement; and all the exalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too had made the same renunciation (Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation), trampled under the same temptations, and achieved at length a marble stare. (13) But the stare Peter Walsh did not want for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others. (14) He could respect it in boys. (15) They don’t know the troubles of the flesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the Strand—all that I’ve been through, he thought, crossing the road, and standing under Gordon’s statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed,—poor Gordon, he thought. (16) And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to him, the strangenessof standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him. (17) What is it? (18) Where am I? (19) And why, after all, does one do it? (20) he thought, the divorce seeming all moonshine. (21) And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might wander. (22) He had not felt so young for years. (23) He had escaped! (24) was utterly free—as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding. (25) I haven’t felt so young for years! (26) thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so) from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window. (27) But she’s extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon’s statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought (susceptible as he was), to shed veilafter veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting. (28) Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket-knife he started after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them, which singled him out, as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts. (29) “You,” she said, only “you,” saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders. (30) Then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past Dent’s shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness, a mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the tired—



But she’s not married; she’s young; quite young, thought Peter, the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar Square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) At half-past one o'clock Timothy drove Miss Polly and her niece to the four or five principal dry goods stores, which were about half a mile from the homestead. (2) Fitting Pollyanna with a new wardrobe proved to be more or less of an exciting experience for all concerned. (3) Miss Polly came out of it with the feeling of limp relaxation that one might have at finding oneself at last on solid earth after a perilous walk across the very thin crust of a volcano. (4) The various clerks who had waited upon the pair came out of it with very red faces, and enough amusing stories of Pollyanna to keep their friends in gales of laughter the rest of the week. (5) Pollyanna herself came out of it with radiant smiles and a heart content; for, as she expressed it to one of the clerks: “When you haven't had anybody but missionary barrels and Ladies' Aiders to dress you, it IS perfectly lovely to just walk right in and buy clothes that are brand-new, and that don't have to be tucked up or let down because they don't fit!”



The shopping expedition consumed the entire afternoon; then came supper and a delightful talk with Old Tom in the garden, and another with Nancy on the back porch, after the dishes were done, and while Aunt Polly paid a visit to a neighbor. (6) Old Tom told Pollyanna wonderful things of her mother, that made her very happy indeed; and Nancy told her all about the little farm six miles away at “The Corners,” where lived her own dear mother, and her equally dear brother and sisters. (7) She promised, too, that sometime, if Miss Polly were willing, Pollyanna should be taken to see them. (8) “And THEY'VE got lovely names, too. (9) You'll like THEIR names,” sighed Nancy. (10) “They're 'Algernon,' and 'Florabelle' and 'Estelle.' (11) I—I just hate 'Nancy'!”

“Oh, Nancy, what a dreadful thing to say! (12) Why?”

“Because it isn't pretty like the others. (13) You see, I was the first baby, and mother hadn't begun ter read so many stories with the pretty names in 'em, then.”



“But I love 'Nancy,' just because it's you,” declared Pollyanna. (14) “Humph! (15) Well, I guess you could love 'Clarissa Mabelle' just as well,” retorted Nancy, “and it would be a heap happier for me. (16) I think THAT name's just grand!”

Pollyanna laughed. (17) “Well, anyhow,” she chuckled, “you can be glad it isn't 'Hephzibah. (18) '”

“Hephzibah!”



“Yes. (19) Mrs. White's name is that. (20) Her husband calls her 'Hep,' and she doesn't like it.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) You—er—flowers and you—that is—I’m sure—you love flowers—you should—er—always have flowers. (2) If I——”

“An’ I’ll get you those red ones and that white one,” broke in the equally infatuated William, determined not to be outshone. (3) “An’ I’ll get you some of my Virginia Stock. (4) An’ I don’t give my Virginia Stock toanyone,” he added with emphasis. (5) When they re-entered the drawing-room, Miss Cannon carried a large bouquet of Virginia Stock and white and red roses which completely hid Robert’s tea-rose. (6) William was by her side, chatting airily and confidently. (7) Robert followed—a pale statue of despair. (8) In answer to Robert’s agonised glance, Mrs.Brown summoned William to her corner, while Robert and Miss Cannon took their seat again upon the sofa. (9) “I hope—I hope,” said Robert soulfully, “I hope your stay here is a long one?”



“Well, why sha’n’t I jus’speakto her?” William’s whisper was loud and indignant. (10) “’Sh, dear!” said Mrs. Brown. (11) “I should like to show you some of the walks around here,” went on Robert desperately with a fearful glance towards the corner where William stood in righteous indignation before his mother. (12) “If I could have that—er—pleasure—er—honour?”

“I was only jus’speakingto her,” went on William’s voice. (13) “I wasn’t doin’ any harm, was I? (14) Onlyspeakingto her!”

The silence was intense. (15) Robert, purple, opened his lips to say something, anything to drown that horrible voice, but nothing would come. (16) Miss Cannon was obviously listening to William. (17) “Is no one else ever tospeakto her.” The sibilant whisper, raised in indignant appeal, filled all the room. (18) “Jus’ ’cause Robert’s fell in love with her?”

The horror of the moment haunted Robert’s nights and days for weeks to come. (19) Mrs. Brown coughed hastily and began to describe at unnecessary length the ravages of the caterpillars upon her husband’s favourite rose-tree. (20) William withdrew with dignity to the garden a minute later and Miss Cannon rose from the sofa. (21) “I must be going, I’m afraid,” she said with a smile. (22) Robert, anguished and overpowered, rose slowly. (23) “You must come again some time,” he said weakly but with passion undaunted. (24) “I will,” she said. (25) “I’m longing to see more of William. (26) I adore William!”

They comforted Robert’s wounded feelings as best they could, but it was Ethel who devised the plan that finally cheered him. (27) She suggested a picnic on the following Thursday, which happened to be Robert’s birthday and incidentally the last day of Miss Cannon’s visit, and the picnic party was to consist of—Robert, Ethel, Mrs. Clive and Miss Cannon, and William was not even to be told where it was to be. (28) The invitation was sent that evening and Robert spent the week dreaming of picnic lunches and suggesting impossible dainties of which the cook had never heard. (29) It was not until she threatened to give notice that he reluctantly agreed to leave the arrangements to her. (30) He sent his white flannels (which were perfectly clean) to the laundry with a note attached, hinting darkly at legal proceedings if they were not sent back, spotless, by Thursday morning.

Book Title: Notes from the Underground

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) But at that time such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed. (2) That was a great vexation to me. (3) Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. (4) At last I determined to challenge my enemy to a duel. (5) I composed a splendid, charming letter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather plainly at a duel in case of refusal. (6) The letter was so composed that if the officer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his friendship. (7) And how fine that would have been! (8) How we should have got on together! (9) “He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I could have improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas, and all sorts of things might have happened.” Only fancy, this was two years after his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. (10) But, thank God (to this day I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to him. (11) Cold shivers run down my back when I think of what might have happened if I had sent it. (12) And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of genius! (13) A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. (14) Sometimes on holidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four o’clock in the afternoon. (15) Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that was just what I wanted. (16) I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. (17) At such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying figure. (18) This was a regular martyrdom, a continual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world, a nasty, disgusting fly—more intelligent, more highly developed, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but a fly that was continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone. (19) Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don’t know. (20) I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity. (21) Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I spoke in the first chapter. (22) After my affair with the officer I felt even more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most frequently, there I could admire him. (23) He, too, went there chiefly on holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. (24) I gloated over my resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for him. (25) It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an even footing with him. (26) “Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the morning. (27) “Why is it you and not he? (28) There’s no regulation about it; there’s no written law. (29) Let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass with mutual respect.”



But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even notice my making way for him.

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) Soon after I got home that summer, I persuaded my grandparents to have their photographs taken, and one morning I went into the photographer’s shop to arrange for sittings. (2) While I was waiting for him to come out of his developing-room, I walked about trying to recognize the likenesses on his walls: girls in Commencement dresses, country brides and grooms holding hands, family groups of three generations. (3) I noticed, in a heavy frame, one of those depressing ‘crayon enlargements’ often seen in farm-house parlours, the subject being a round-eyed baby in short dresses. (4) The photographer came out and gave a constrained, apologetic laugh. (5) ‘That’s Tony Shimerda’s baby. (6) You remember her; she used to be the Harlings’ Tony. (7) Too bad! (8) She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn’t hear to a cheap frame for the picture. (9) I expect her brother will be in for it Saturday.’



I went away feeling that I must see Ántonia again. (10) Another girl would have kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its picture on exhibition at the town photographer’s, in a great gilt frame. (11) How like her! (12) I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn’t thrown herself away on such a cheap sort of fellow. (13) Larry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew aristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up a car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service, silently point to the button that calls the porter. (14) Larry wore this air of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no car-windows to compromise his dignity. (15) At the end of his run he stepped indifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street hat on his head and his conductor’s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went directly into the station and changed his clothes. (16) It was a matter of the utmost importance to him never to be seen in his blue trousers away from his train. (17) He was usually cold and distant with men, but with all women he had a silent, grave familiarity, a special handshake, accompanied by a significant, deliberate look. (18) He took women, married or single, into his confidence; walked them up and down in the moonlight, telling them what a mistake he had made by not entering the office branch of the service, and how much better fitted he was to fill the post of General Passenger Agent in Denver than the rough-shod man who then bore that title. (19) His unappreciated worth was the tender secret Larry shared with his sweethearts, and he was always able to make some foolish heart ache over it. (20) As I drew near home that morning, I saw Mrs. Harling out in her yard, digging round her mountain-ash tree. (21) It was a dry summer, and she had now no boy to help her. (22) Charley was off in his battleship, cruising somewhere on the Caribbean sea. (23) I turned in at the gate it was with a feeling of pleasure that I opened and shut that gate in those days; I liked the feel of it under my hand. (24) I took the spade away from Mrs. Harling, and while I loosened the earth around the tree, she sat down on the steps and talked about the oriole family that had a nest in its branches. (25) ‘Mrs. (26) Harling,’ I said presently, ‘I wish I could find out exactly how Ántonia’s marriage fell through.’



‘Why don’t you go out and see your grandfather’s tenant, the Widow Steavens? (27) She knows more about it than anybody else. (28) She helped Ántonia get ready to be married, and she was there when Ántonia came back.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) “Old longings nomadic leap,Chafing at custom’s chain;Again from its brumal sleepWakens the ferine strain.”



Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. (2) Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. (3) These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost. (4) Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. (5) Judge Miller’s place, it was called. (6) It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. (7) The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. (8) At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. (9) There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. (10) Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon. (11) And over this great demesne Buck ruled. (12) Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. (13) It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. (14) They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. (15) On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops. (16) But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. (17) The whole realm was his. (18) He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. (19) Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included. (20) His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. (21) He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. (22) Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. (23) During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. (24) But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. (25) Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver. (26) And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North. (27) But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel, one of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. (28) Manuel had one besetting sin. (29) He loved to play Chinese lottery.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams. (2) Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. (3) At first he did not know where he was. (4) It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. (5) The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. (6) It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. (7) The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. (8) Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before. (9) A shout from François hailed his appearance. (10) “Wot I say?” the dog-driver cried to Perrault. (11) “Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt’ing.”

Perrault nodded gravely. (12) As courier for the Canadian Government, bearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck. (13) Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Cañon. (14) Buck was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it. (15) He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. (16) They were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. (17) All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them. (18) They were alert and active, anxious that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by delay or confusion, retarded that work. (19) The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight. (20) Dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file, to the leader, which position was filled by Spitz. (21) Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he might receive instruction. (22) Apt scholar that he was, they were equally apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth. (23) Dave was fair and very wise. (24) He never nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it. (25) As François’s whip backed him up, Buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. (26) Once, during a brief halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both Dave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. (27) The resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. (28) François’s whip snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them. (29) It was a hard day’s run, up the Cañon, through Sheep Camp, past the Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) Mrs. Brown coughed hastily and began to describe at unnecessary length the ravages of the caterpillars upon her husband’s favourite rose-tree. (2) William withdrew with dignity to the garden a minute later and Miss Cannon rose from the sofa. (3) “I must be going, I’m afraid,” she said with a smile. (4) Robert, anguished and overpowered, rose slowly. (5) “You must come again some time,” he said weakly but with passion undaunted. (6) “I will,” she said. (7) “I’m longing to see more of William. (8) I adore William!”

They comforted Robert’s wounded feelings as best they could, but it was Ethel who devised the plan that finally cheered him. (9) She suggested a picnic on the following Thursday, which happened to be Robert’s birthday and incidentally the last day of Miss Cannon’s visit, and the picnic party was to consist of—Robert, Ethel, Mrs. Clive and Miss Cannon, and William was not even to be told where it was to be. (10) The invitation was sent that evening and Robert spent the week dreaming of picnic lunches and suggesting impossible dainties of which the cook had never heard. (11) It was not until she threatened to give notice that he reluctantly agreed to leave the arrangements to her. (12) He sent his white flannels (which were perfectly clean) to the laundry with a note attached, hinting darkly at legal proceedings if they were not sent back, spotless, by Thursday morning. (13) He went about with an expression of set and solemn purpose upon his frowning countenance. (14) William he utterly ignored. (15) He bought a book of poems at a second-hand bookshop and kept them on the table by his bed. (16) They saw nothing of Miss Cannon in the interval, but Thursday dawned bright and clear, and Robert’s anxious spirits rose. (17) He was presented with a watch and chain by his father and with abicycle by his mother and a tin of toffee (given not without ulterior motive) by William. (18) They met Mrs. Clive and Miss Cannon at the station and took tickets to a village a few miles away whence they had decided to walk to a shady spot on the river bank. (19) William’s dignity was slightly offended by his pointed exclusion from the party, but he had resigned himself to it, and spent the first part of the morning in the character of Chief Red Hand among the rhododendron bushes. (20) He had added an ostrich feather found in Ethel’s room to his head-dress, and used almost a whole cork on his face. (21) He wore the door-mat pinned to his shoulders. (22) After melting some treacle toffee in rain-water over his smoking fire, adding orange juice and drinking the resulting liquid, he tired of the game and wandered upstairs to Robert’s bedroom to inspect his birthday presents. (23) The tin of toffee was on the table by Robert’s bed. (24) William took one or two as a matter of course and began to read the love-poems. (25) He was horrified a few minutes later to see the tin empty, but he fastened the lid with a sigh, wondering if Robert would guess who had eaten them. (26) He was afraid he would. (27) Anyway he’d given him them. (28) And anyway, he hadn’t known he was eating them. (29) He then went to the dressing-table and tried on the watch and chain at various angles and with various postures. (30) He finally resisted the temptation to wear them for the rest of the morning and replaced them on the dressing-table.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) Like other men, they passed out of Buck’s life for good. (2) A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson. (3) It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train, carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the Pole. (4) Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates, whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. (5) It was a monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. (6) One day was very like another. (7) At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. (8) Then, while some broke camp, others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. (9) At night, camp was made. (10) Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. (11) Also, the dogs were fed. (12) To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. (13) There were fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way. (14) Best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames. (15) Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller’s big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the Japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat. (16) He was not homesick. (17) The Sunland was very dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. (18) Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again. (19) Sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed cook before him. (20) This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm, with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling. (21) The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head slanted back under it from the eyes. (22) He uttered strange sounds, and seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. (23) He was all but naked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body there was much hair. (24) In some places, across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a thick fur. (25) He did not stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. (26) About his body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen. (27) At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept. (28) On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms. (29) And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) His cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence, shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild. (2) A carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his life, overspilling with vigor and virility. (3) When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. (4) Every part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment. (5) To sights and sounds and events which required action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. (6) Quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could leap twice as quickly. (7) He saw the movement, or heard sound, and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing. (8) He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant. (9) In point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. (10) His muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel springs. (11) Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world. (12) “Never was there such a dog,” said John Thornton one day, as the partners watched Buck marching out of camp. (13) “When he was made, the mould was broke,” said Pete. (14) “Py jingo! (15) I t’ink so mineself,” Hans affirmed. (16) They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest. (17) He no longer marched. (18) At once he became a thing of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows. (19) He knew how to take advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like a snake to leap and strike. (20) He could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees. (21) Fish, in open pools, were not too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. (22) He killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed himself. (23) So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops. (24) As the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys. (25) Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. (26) A band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber, and chief among them was a great bull. (27) He was in a savage temper, and, standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist as even Buck could desire. (28) Back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips. (29) His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light, while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) And I will make you rich for the rest of your life.”—“No, sire,” said the shepherd, “that I cannot do. (2) She is my only child, and I want her to take care of me whenI am old. (3) Besides, if theLindwormwould not spare two beautiful Princesses, he won’t spare her either. (4) He will just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such a fate.”



But theKingwouldn’t take “No” for an answer: and at last the old man had to give in. (5) Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that she was to bePrince Lindworm’sbride, she was utterly in despair. (6) She went out into the woods, crying and wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. (7) And while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and asked her, “Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?” The shepherd-girl said, “It’s no use my telling you, for nobody in the world can help me.”—“Oh, you never know,” said the old woman. (8) “Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right.”—“Ah, how can you?” said the girl, “For I am to be married to theKing’seldest son, who is aLindworm. (9) He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and devoured them: and he will eat me too! (10) No wonder I am distressed.”

“Well, you needn’t be,” said thewitch-woman. (11) “Allthat can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do exactly as I tell you.” So the girl said she would. (12) “Listen, then,” said the old woman. (13) “After the marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white shifts. (14) And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,” (that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) “and a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can carry in his arms,—and have all these brought into your bed-chamber. (15) Then, when theLindwormtells you to shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. (16) And when all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in your arms, if it’s only for one moment.”



“The last is the worst notion—ugh!” said the shepherd’s daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of holding the cold, slimy, scalyLindworm. (17) “Do just as I have said, and all will go well,” said the old woman. (18) Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree. (19) When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and takento the castle to be decked as a bride. (20) And she asked for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy could carry in his arms. (21) The ladies and courtiers in the castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. (22) But theKingsaid, “Let her have whatever she asks for.” She was then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked the loveliest of brides. (23) She was led to the hall where the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw theLindwormfor the first time as he came in and stood by her side. (24) So they were married, and a great wedding-feast was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king. (25) She saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side. (26) When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride were conducted to their apartment, with music, and torches, and a great procession. (27) As soon as the door was shut, theLindwormturned to her and said, “Fair maiden, shed a shift!” The shepherd’s daughter answered him, “Prince Lindworm, slough a skin!”—“No one has ever dared tell me to do that before!” said he. (28) “But I command you to do it now!” said she. (29) Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him.The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of the skin. (30) TheLindwormsaid again to her, “Fair maiden, shed a shift.”



The shepherd’s daughter answered him, “Prince Lindworm, slough a skin.”



“No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,” said he. (31) “But I command you to do it now,” said she.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. (2) But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. (3) Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock. (4) He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets. (5) Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. (6) They sought no farther. (7) Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. (8) The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. (9) Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up. (10) There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. (11) The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered. (12) The salient thing of this other world seemed fear. (13) When he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands clasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire. (14) Did they walk by the beach of a sea, where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. (15) Through the forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man’s heels; and they were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. (16) The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing his grip. (17) In fact, he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he slept. (18) And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest. (19) It filled him with a great unrest and strange desires. (20) It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what. (21) Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood might dictate. (22) He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or into the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him. (23) It might be, lying thus, that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. (24) But he did not know why he did these various things. (25) He was impelled to do them, and did not reason about them at all. (26) Irresistible impulses seized him. (27) He would be lying in camp, dozing lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. (28) He loved to run down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods. (29) For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down.

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) ‘Miss Lingard,’ he said haughtily, ‘is a young woman for whom I have the utmost, the utmost respect.’



‘So have I,’ I said coldly. (2) He paid no heed to my remark, but began to do rapid finger-exercises on his shirt-sleeves, as he stood with tightly folded arms. (3) ‘Kindness of heart,’ he went on, staring at the ceiling, ‘sentiment, are not understood in a place like this. (4) The noblest qualities are ridiculed. (5) Grinning college boys, ignorant and conceited, what do they know of delicacy!’



I controlled my features and tried to speak seriously. (6) ‘If you mean me, Mr. Ordinsky, I have known Miss Lingard a long time, and I think I appreciate her kindness. (7) We come from the same town, and we grew up together.’



His gaze travelled slowly down from the ceiling and rested on me. (8) ‘Am I to understand that you have this young woman’s interests at heart? (9) That you do not wish to compromise her?’

‘That’s a word we don’t use much here, Mr. Ordinsky. (10) A girl who makes her own living can ask a college boy to supper without being talked about. (11) We take some things for granted.’

‘Then I have misjudged you, and I ask your pardon’—he bowed gravely. (12) ‘Miss Lingard,’ he went on, ‘is an absolutely trustful heart. (13) She has not learned the hard lessons of life. (14) As for you and me, noblesse oblige’—he watched me narrowly. (15) Lena returned with the vest. (16) ‘Come in and let us look at you as you go out, Mr. Ordinsky. (17) I’ve never seen you in your dress suit,’ she said as she opened the door for him. (18) A few moments later he reappeared with his violin-case a heavy muffler about his neck and thick woollen gloves on his bony hands. (19) Lena spoke encouragingly to him, and he went off with such an important professional air that we fell to laughing as soon as we had shut the door. (20) ‘Poor fellow,’ Lena said indulgently, ‘he takes everything so hard.’



After that Ordinsky was friendly to me, and behaved as if there were some deep understanding between us. (21) He wrote a furious article, attacking the musical taste of the town, and asked me to do him a great service by taking it to the editor of the morning paper. (22) If the editor refused to print it, I was to tell him that he would be answerable to Ordinsky ‘in person.’ He declared that he would never retract one word, and that he was quite prepared to lose all his pupils. (23) In spite of the fact that nobody ever mentioned his article to him after it appeared—full of typographical errors which he thought intentional—he got a certain satisfaction from believing that the citizens of Lincoln had meekly accepted the epithet ‘coarse barbarians.’ ‘You see how it is,’ he said to me, ‘where there is no chivalry, there is no amour-propre.’ When I met him on his rounds now, I thought he carried his head more disdainfully than ever, and strode up the steps of front porches and rang doorbells with more assurance. (24) He told Lena he would never forget how I had stood by him when he was ‘under fire.’



All this time, of course, I was drifting. (25) Lena had broken up my serious mood. (26) I wasn’t interested in my classes. (27) I played with Lena and Prince, I played with the Pole, I went buggy-riding with the old colonel, who had taken a fancy to me and used to talk to me about Lena and the ‘great beauties’ he had known in his youth. (28) We were all three in love with Lena. (29) Before the first of June, Gaston Cleric was offered an instructorship at Harvard College, and accepted it. (30) He suggested that I should follow him in the fall, and complete my course at Harvard.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) Miss Cannon appeared upon the threshold, bewitching and demure. (2) “Aren’t I perfectly disgraceful?” she said with her low laugh. (3) “To tell the truth, I met your littleboy in the drive and I’ve been with him some time. (4) He’s a perfect little dear, isn’t he?”

Her brown eyes rested on Robert. (5) Robert moistened his lips and smiled the tortured smile, but was beyond speech. (6) “Yes, I know Ethel and I met your son—yesterday, wasn’t it?”



Robert murmured unintelligibly, raising one hand to the too tight collar, and then bowed vaguely in her direction. (7) Then they went in to tea. (8) William, his hair well brushed, the cork partially washed from his face, and the feathers removed, arrived a few minutes later. (9) Conversation was carried on chiefly by Miss Cannon and Ethel. (10) Robert racked his brain for some striking remark, something that would raise him in her esteem far above the ranks of the ordinary young man, but nothing came. (11) Whenever her brown eyes rested on him, however, he summoned the mirthless smile to his lips and raised a hand to relieve the strain of the imprisoning collar. (12) Desperately he felt the precious moments passing and his passion yet unrevealed, except by his eyes, whose message he was afraid she had not read. (13) As they rose from tea, William turned to his mother, with an anxious sibilant whisper,



“OughtIto have put on my best suittoo?”



The demure lights danced in Miss Cannon’s eyes and the look the perspiring Robert sent him would have crushed a less bold spirit. (14) William had quite forgotten the orders he had received to retire from the scene directly after tea. (15) He was impervious to all hints. (16) He followedin the train of the all-conquering Miss Cannon to the drawing-room and sat on the sofa with Robert who had taken his seat next his beloved. (17) “Are you—er—fond of reading, Miss Cannon?” began Robert with a painful effort. (18) “I—wrotea tale once,” said William boastfully, leaning over Robert before she could answer. (19) “It was a jolly good one. (20) I showed it to some people. (21) I’ll show it to you if you like. (22) It began with a pirate on a raft an’ he’d stole some jewel’ry and the king the jewels belonged to was coming after him on a steamer and jus’ when he was comin’ up to him he jumped into the water and took the jewls with him an’ a fish eat the jewls and the king caught it an’,” he paused for breath. (23) “I’d love to read it!” said Miss Cannon. (24) Robert turned sideways, and resting an arm on his knee to exclude the persistent William, spoke in a husky voice. (25) “What is your favourite flower, Miss Cannon?”

William’s small head was craned round Robert’s arm. (26) “I’ve gotter garden. (27) I’ve got Virginia Stock grow’n all over it. (28) It grows up in no time. (29) An’ must’erd ’n cress grows in no time, too. (30) I like things what grow quick, don’t you?

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) “Oh, but Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, you haven't left me any time at all just to—to live.”



“To live, child! (2) What do you mean? (3) As if you weren't living all the time!”

“Oh, of course I'd be BREATHING all the time I was doing those things, Aunt Polly, but I wouldn't be living. (4) You breathe all the time you're asleep, but you aren't living. (5) I mean living—doing the things you want to do: playing outdoors, reading (to myself, of course), climbing hills, talking to Mr. Tom in the garden, and Nancy, and finding out all about the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday. (6) That's what I call living, Aunt Polly. (7) Just breathing isn't living!”

Miss Polly lifted her head irritably. (8) “Pollyanna, you ARE the most extraordinary child! (9) You will be allowed a proper amount of playtime, of course. (10) But, surely, it seems to me if I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and instruction, YOU ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted.”



Pollyanna looked shocked. (11) “Oh, Aunt Polly, as if I ever could be ungrateful—to YOU! (12) Why, I LOVE YOU—and you aren't even a Ladies' Aider; you're an aunt!”



“Very well; then see that you don't act ungrateful,” vouchsafed Miss Polly, as she turned toward the door. (13) She had gone halfway down the stairs when a small, unsteady voice called after her:



“Please, Aunt Polly, you didn't tell me which of my things you wanted to—to give away.”



Aunt Polly emitted a tired sigh—a sigh that ascended straight to Pollyanna's ears. (14) “Oh, I forgot to tell you, Pollyanna. (15) Timothy will drive us into town at half-past one this afternoon. (16) Not one of your garments is fit for my niece to wear. (17) Certainly I should be very far from doing my duty by you if I should let you appear out in any one of them.”



Pollyanna sighed now—she believed she was going to hate that word—duty. (18) “Aunt Polly, please,” she called wistfully, “isn't there ANY way you can be glad about all that—duty business?”



“What?” Miss Polly looked up in dazed surprise; then, suddenly, with very red cheeks, she turned and swept angrily down the stairs. (19) “Don't be impertinent, Pollyanna!”

In the hot little attic room Pollyanna dropped herself on to one of the straight-backed chairs. (20) To her, existence loomed ahead one endless round of duty. (21) “I don't see, really, what there was impertinent about that,” she sighed. (22) “I was only asking her if she couldn't tell me something to be glad about in all that duty business.”



For several minutes Pollyanna sat in silence, her rueful eyes fixed on the forlorn heap of garments on the bed. (23) Then, slowly, she rose and began to put away the dresses. (24) “There just isn't anything to be glad about, that I can see,” she said aloud; “unless—it's to be glad when the duty's done!” Whereupon she laughed suddenly.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name wasHalvor. (2) Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes. (3) His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, butHalvorcould stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders. (4) Well, one day a skipper came, and askedHalvorif he hadn’t a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands. (5) Yes,Halvorwould like that very much; so he wasn’t long in getting himself ready. (6) How long they sailed I’m sure I can’t tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn’t tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about. (7) Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, andHalvorasked the skipper’s leave to go on shore and look about him; he wouldsooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep. (8) “Do you think now you’re fit to show yourself before folk,” said the skipper, “why, you’ve no clothes but those rags you stand in?”



ButHalvorstuck to his own, and so at last he got leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. (9) So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields and rich meads, but he couldn’t catch a glimpse of a living soul. (10) Well, it began to blow, butHalvorthought he hadn’t seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldn’t meet any folk. (11) So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it.Halvorfollowed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone. (12) So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn’t taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got. (13) In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, andHalvorwent into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. (14) It was so grand and fine; therewere vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul. (15) So whenHalvorhad stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat aPrincesswho span upon a spinning-wheel. (16) “Nay, nay, now!” she called out, “dare Christian folk come hither? (17) But now you’d best be off about your business, if you don’t want theTrollto gobble you up; for here lives aTrollwith three heads.”



“All one to me,” said the lad, “I’d be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I’d like to see what kind of fellow he is. (18) As for going, I won’t go at all. (19) I’ve done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I’m almost starved to death.”



WhenHalvorhad eaten his fill, thePrincesstold him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn’t brandish it, he couldn’t even lift it up. (20) “Oh!” said thePrincess, “now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that’s what theTrolldoes every time he goes out to use the sword.”



SoHalvortook a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time theTrollcame; and lo! (21) just then up came theTrollpuffing and blowing.Halvorjumped behind the door. (22) “,” said theTroll, as he put his head in at the door, “what a smell of Christian man’s blood!”



“Aye,” saidHalvor, “you’ll soon know that to your cost,” and with that he hewed off all his heads. (23) Now thePrincesswas so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:



“Would my sisters were free too!”



“Where are they?” askedHalvor. (24) Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by aTrollto his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by anotherTrollto his Castle which was fifty miles further still.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) The Outlaws sat around the old barn, plunged in deep thought. (2) Henry, the oldest member (aged 12¼) had said in a moment of inspiration:



“Let’s think of—sumthin’ else to do—sumthin’ quite fresh from what we’ve ever done before.”



And the Outlaws were thinking. (3) They had engaged in mortal combat with one another, they had cooked strange ingredients over a smoking and reluctant flame with a fine disregard of culinary conventions, they had tracked each other over the country-side with gait and complexions intended to represent those of the aborigines of South America, they had even turned their attention to kidnapping (without any striking success), and these occupations had palled. (4) In all its activities the Society of Outlaws (comprising four members) aimed at a simple, unostentatious mode of procedure. (5) In their shrinking from the glare of publicity they showed an example of unaffected modesty that many other public societies might profitably emulate. (6) The parents of the members were unaware of the very existence of the society. (7) The ill-timed and tactless interferenceof parents had nipped in the bud many a cherished plan, and by bitter experience the Outlaws had learnt that secrecy was their only protection. (8) Owing to the rules and restrictions of an unsympathetic world that orders school hours from 9 to 4 their meetings were confined to half-holidays and occasionally Sunday afternoons. (9) William, the ever ingenious, made the first suggestion. (10) “Let’s shoot things with bows an’ arrows same as real outlaws used to,” he said. (11) “What things?” and

“What bows an’ arrows?” said Henry and Ginger simultaneously. (12) “Oh, anything—birds an’ cats an’ hens an’ things—an’ buy bows an’ arrows. (13) You can buy them in shops.”

“We can make them,” said Douglas, hopefully. (14) “Not like you can get them in shops. (15) They’d shoot crooked or sumthin’ if we made them. (16) They’ve got to be jus’ so to shoot straight. (17) I saw some in Brook’s window, too, jus’ right—jus’ same as real outlaws had.”



“How much?” said the outlaws breathlessly. (18) “Five shillings—targets for learnin’ on before we begin shootin’ real things an’ all.”



“Five shillings!” breathed Douglas. (19) He might as well have said five pounds. (20) “We’ve not got five shillings. (21) Henry’s not having any money since he broke their drawing-room window an’ Ginger only has 3d.a week an’ has to give collection an’ we’ve not paid for the guinea pig yet, the one that got into Ginger’s sister’s hat an’ she was so mad at, an’——”



“Oh, never mind all that,” said William, scornfully. (22) “We’ll jus’ get five shillings.”

“How?”



“Well,” uncertainly, “grown-ups can always get money when they want it.”



“How?”

 again. (23) William disliked being tied down to details. (24) “Oh—bazaars an’ things,” impatiently.

Book Title: Notes from the Underground

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) And I could hardly have resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it. (2) What could have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the street? (3) No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all. (4) And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times in those dreams of mine! (5) in those “flights into the sublime and the beautiful”; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have been superfluous. (6) Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. (7) I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. (8) I was a poet and a grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not merely shameful, but had in them much that was “sublime and beautiful” something in the Manfred style. (9) Everyone would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. (10) Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on—as though you did not know all about it? (11) You will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public after all the tears and transports which I have myself confessed. (12) But why is it contemptible? (13) Can you imagine that I am ashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? (14) And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly composed.... (15) It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. (16) And yet you are right—it really is vulgar and contemptible. (17) And most contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to you. (18) And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark now. (19) But that’s enough, or there will be no end to it; each step will be more contemptible than the last.... (20) I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. (21) To plunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin. (22) He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now. (23) But I only went to see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one human being, actually existing. (24) I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on Tuesday—his at-home day; so I had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a Tuesday. (25) This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five Corners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a particularly frugal and sallow appearance. (26) He had two daughters and their aunt, who used to pour out the tea. (27) Of the daughters one was thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling together. (28) The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a colleague from our office or some other department. (29) I never saw more than two or three visitors there, always the same.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you to him.”



Yes! (2) she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren’t so very long on the way, I should think. (3) When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that layEast of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had thePrincewho lived there. (4) “You don’t say so! (5) That’s she, is it?” said the South Wind. (6) “Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I’ll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don’t know where it is, you’ll never find any one in the world to tell you. (7) You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you thither.”



Yes! (8) she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. (9) And this time, too, she wasn’t long on her way. (10) So when they got to the North Wind’s house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off. (11) “” he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver. (12) “Well,” said the South Wind, “you needn’t be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had thePrincewho dwells in the castle that liesEast of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again.”



“,” said the NorthWind; “once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn’t blow a puff for ever so many days, after. (13) But if you really wish to go thither, and aren’t afraid to come along with me, I’ll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither.”



Yes! (14) with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn’t be at all afraid. (15) “Very well, then,” said the North Wind, “but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we’re to get thither at all.”



Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, ’twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world’s end. (16) Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds. (17) The North Wind goes over the sea. (18) So they tore on and on—no one can believe how far they went—and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and hiswings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels. (19) “Are you afraid?” said the North Wind. (20) “No!” she wasn’t. (21) But they weren’t very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which layEast of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again. (22) Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was theLong-nosewho was to have thePrince. (23) “What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?” said theLong-nose, and threw up the window. (24) “It’s not for sale, for gold or money,” said the lassie. (25) “If it’s not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? (26) You may name your own price,” said thePrincess. (27) “Well! (28) if I may get to thePrince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,” said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought. (29) Yes! (30) she might; that could be done.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) Mr. Hopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer. (2) Why his career was so short, I do not know, but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd. (3) Mr. Hopkins was succeeded by Mr. Austin Gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer. (4) Mr. Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm. (5) Mr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. (6) He was artful, cruel, and obdurate. (7) He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such a man. (8) It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. (9) He was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly. (10) There must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. (11) Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,—“It is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.” No matter how innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing, when accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. (12) To be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty. (13) To escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of Mr. Gore. (14) He was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master. (15) He was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. (16) He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience. (17) He was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves. (18) His presence was painful; his eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks. (19) Mr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled. (20) His words were in perfect keeping with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words. (21) Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with Mr. Gore. (22) He spoke but to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully with his whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as well. (23) When he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. (24) He did nothing reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent. (25) He never promised but to fulfil. (26) He was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness. (27) His savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge. (28) Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, by the name of Demby. (29) He had given Demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders, refusing to come out.

Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. (6) For Lucy had her work cut out for her. (7) The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer’s men were coming. (8) And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning—fresh as if issued to children on a beach. (9) What a lark! (10) What a plunge! (11) For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. (12) How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until PeterWalsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?”—was that it? (13) “I prefer men to cauliflowers”—was that it? (14) He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace—Peter Walsh. (15) He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished—how strange it was! (16) a few sayings like this about cabbages. (17) She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to pass. (18) A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness. (19) There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright. (20) For having lived in Westminster—how many years now? (21) over twenty,—one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by

 influenza) beforeBig Ben strikes. (22) There! (23) Out it boomed. (24) First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. (25) The leaden circles dissolved in the air. (26) Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street. (27) For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by

 Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. (28) In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June. (29) For it was the middle of June. (30) The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven—over.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) “You were coming up to see me! (2) Come right in. (3) I love company,” she finished, scampering up the stairs and throwing her door wide open. (4) Now Miss Polly had not been intending to call on her niece. (5) She had been planning to look for a certain white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window. (6) But to her unbounded surprise now, she found herself, not in the main attic before the cedar chest, but in Pollyanna's little room sitting in one of the straight-backed chairs—so many, many times since Pollyanna came, Miss Polly had found herself like this, doing some utterly unexpected, surprising thing, quite unlike the thing she had set out to do! (7) “I love company,” said Pollyanna, again, flitting about as if she were dispensing the hospitality of a palace; “specially since I've had this room, all mine, you know. (8) Oh, of course, I had a room, always, but 'twas a hired room, and hired rooms aren't half as nice as owned ones, are they? (9) And of course I do own this one, don't I?”

“Why, y-yes, Pollyanna,” murmured Miss Polly, vaguely wondering why she did not get up at once and go to look for that shawl. (10) “And of course NOW I just love this room, even if it hasn't got the carpets and curtains and pictures that I'd been want—” With a painful blush Pollyanna stopped short. (11) She was plunging into an entirely different sentence when her aunt interrupted her sharply. (12) “What's that, Pollyanna?”

“N-nothing, Aunt Polly, truly. (13) I didn't mean to say it.”

“Probably not,” returned Miss Polly, coldly; “but you did say it, so suppose we have the rest of it.”



“But it wasn't anything only that I'd been kind of planning on pretty carpets and lace curtains and things, you know. (14) But, of course—”

“PLANNING on them!” interrupted Miss Polly, sharply. (15) Pollyanna blushed still more painfully. (16) “I ought not to have, of course, Aunt Polly,” she apologized. (17) “It was only because I'd always wanted them and hadn't had them, I suppose. (18) Oh, we'd had two rugs in the barrels, but they were little, you know, and one had ink spots, and the other holes; and there never were only those two pictures; the one fath—I mean the good one we sold, and the bad one that broke. (19) Of course if it hadn't been for all that I shouldn't have wanted them, so—pretty things, I mean; and I shouldn't have got to planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be here, and—and—but, truly, Aunt Polly, it wasn't but just a minute—I mean, a few minutes—before I was being glad that the bureau DIDN'T have a looking-glass, because it didn't show my freckles; and there couldn't be a nicer picture than the one out my window there; and you've been so good to me, that—”



Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet. (20) Her face was very red. (21) “That will do, Pollyanna,” she said stiffly. (22) “You have said quite enough, I'm sure.” The next minute she had swept down the stairs—and not until she reached the first floor did it suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window. (23) Less than twenty-four hours later, Miss Polly said to Nancy, crisply:



“Nancy, you may move Miss Pollyanna's things down-stairs this morning to the room directly beneath. (24) I have decided to have my niece sleep there for the present.”



“Yes, ma'am,” said Nancy aloud. (25) “O glory!” said Nancy to herself. (26) To Pollyanna, a minute later, she cried joyously:



“And won't ye jest be listenin' ter this, Miss Pollyanna. (27) You're ter sleep down-stairs in the room straight under this. (28) You are—you are!”

Pollyanna actually grew white. (29) “You mean—why, Nancy, not really—really and truly?”



“I guess you'll think it's really and truly,” prophesied Nancy, exultingly, nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she had taken from the closet. (30) “I'm told ter take down yer things, and I'm goin' ter take 'em, too, 'fore she gets a chance ter change her mind.”



Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence.

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) But every one of them did what she had set out to do, and sent home those hard-earned dollars. (2) The girls I knew were always helping to pay for ploughs and reapers, brood-sows, or steers to fatten. (3) One result of this family solidarity was that the foreign farmers in our county were the first to become prosperous. (4) After the fathers were out of debt, the daughters married the sons of neighbours—usually of like nationality—and the girls who once worked in Black Hawk kitchens are to-day managing big farms and fine families of their own; their children are better off than the children of the town women they used to serve. (5) I thought the attitude of the town people toward these girls very stupid. (6) If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard’s grandfather was a clergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly. (7) What did it matter? (8) All foreigners were ignorant people who couldn’t speak English. (9) There was not a man in Black Hawk who had the intelligence or cultivation, much less the personal distinction, of Ántonia’s father. (10) Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all ‘hired girls.’



I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. (11) To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. (12) The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. (13) But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father’s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings. (14) The country girls were considered a menace to the social order. (15) Their beauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. (16) But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm. (17) They mistook the mettle of their sons. (18) The respect for respectability was stronger than any desire in Black Hawk youth. (19) Our young man of position was like the son of a royal house; the boy who swept out his office or drove his delivery wagon might frolic with the jolly country girls, but he himself must sit all evening in a plush parlour where conversation dragged so perceptibly that the father often came in and made blundering efforts to warm up the atmosphere. (20) On his way home from his dull call, he would perhaps meet Tony and Lena, coming along the sidewalk whispering to each other, or the three Bohemian Marys in their long plush coats and caps, comporting themselves with a dignity that only made their eventful histories the more piquant. (21) If he went to the hotel to see a travelling man on business, there was Tiny, arching her shoulders at him like a kitten. (22) If he went into the laundry to get his collars, there were the four Danish girls, smiling up from their ironing-boards, with their white throats and their pink cheeks. (23) The three Marys were the heroines of a cycle of scandalous stories, which the old men were fond of relating as they sat about the cigar-stand in the drugstore. (24) Mary Dusak had been housekeeper for a bachelor rancher from Boston, and after several years in his service she was forced to retire from the world for a short time. (25) Later she came back to town to take the place of her friend, Mary Svoboda, who was similarly embarrassed. (26) The three Marys were considered as dangerous as high explosives to have about the kitchen, yet they were such good cooks and such admirable housekeepers that they never had to look for a place. (27) The Vannis’ tent brought the town boys and the country girls together on neutral ground. (28) Sylvester Lovett, who was cashier in his father’s bank, always found his way to the tent on Saturday night. (29) He took all the dances Lena Lingard would give him, and even grew bold enough to walk home with her. (30) If his sisters or their friends happened to be among the onlookers on ‘popular nights,’ Sylvester stood back in the shadow under the cottonwood trees, smoking and watching Lena with a harassed expression.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore. (2) So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange. (3) I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness. (4) We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. (5) I remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month, nor the months of the year. (6) On setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would be the last look. (7) I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things near by or behind. (8) In the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the State. (9) We stopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on shore. (10) It was the first large town that I had ever seen, and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages, I thought it a wonderful place for its size—more imposing even than the Great House Farm! (11) We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith’s Wharf, not far from Bowley’s Wharf. (12) We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr. Curtis on Louden Slater’s Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home in Alliciana Street, near Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard, on Fells Point. (13) Mr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met me at the door with their little son Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given. (14) And here I saw what I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions; it was the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld. (15) I wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it. (16) It was a new and strange sight to me, brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness. (17) Little Thomas was told, there was his Freddy,—and I was told to take care of little Thomas; and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead. (18) I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd’s plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life. (19) It is possible, and even quite probable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of slavery. (20) Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. (21) I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. (22) I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. (23) There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. (24) There were those younger, those older, and those of the same age. (25) I was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice. (26) I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. (27) But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion. (28) I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence. (29) From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom. (30) This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.

Book Title: The call of the wild

Book Author: Jack London

Paragraph: (1) He must master or be mastered; while to show mercy was a weakness. (2) Mercy did not exist in the primordial life. (3) It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. (4) Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out of the depths of Time, he obeyed. (5) He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. (6) He linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed. (7) He sat by John Thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting, tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank, scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods, directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down, and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams. (8) So peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. (9) Deep in the forest a call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. (10) But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again. (11) Thornton alone held him. (12) The rest of mankind was as nothing. (13) Chance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. (14) When Thornton’s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. (15) They were of the same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth, thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his ways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig. (16) For Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. (17) He, alone among men, could put a pack upon Buck’s back in the summer travelling. (18) Nothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. (19) One day (they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three hundred feet below. (20) John Thornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his shoulder. (21) A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind. (22) “Jump, Buck!” he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. (23) The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety. (24) “It’s uncanny,” Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their speech. (25) Thornton shook his head. (26) “No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too. (27) Do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.”

“I’m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he’s around,” Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck. (28) “Py Jingo!” was Hans’s contribution. (29) “Not mineself either.”

It was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete’s apprehensions were realized. (30) “Black” Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton stepped good-naturedly between.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) “I ought not to have, of course, Aunt Polly,” she apologized. (2) “It was only because I'd always wanted them and hadn't had them, I suppose. (3) Oh, we'd had two rugs in the barrels, but they were little, you know, and one had ink spots, and the other holes; and there never were only those two pictures; the one fath—I mean the good one we sold, and the bad one that broke. (4) Of course if it hadn't been for all that I shouldn't have wanted them, so—pretty things, I mean; and I shouldn't have got to planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be here, and—and—but, truly, Aunt Polly, it wasn't but just a minute—I mean, a few minutes—before I was being glad that the bureau DIDN'T have a looking-glass, because it didn't show my freckles; and there couldn't be a nicer picture than the one out my window there; and you've been so good to me, that—”



Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet. (5) Her face was very red. (6) “That will do, Pollyanna,” she said stiffly. (7) “You have said quite enough, I'm sure.” The next minute she had swept down the stairs—and not until she reached the first floor did it suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window. (8) Less than twenty-four hours later, Miss Polly said to Nancy, crisply:



“Nancy, you may move Miss Pollyanna's things down-stairs this morning to the room directly beneath. (9) I have decided to have my niece sleep there for the present.”



“Yes, ma'am,” said Nancy aloud. (10) “O glory!” said Nancy to herself. (11) To Pollyanna, a minute later, she cried joyously:



“And won't ye jest be listenin' ter this, Miss Pollyanna. (12) You're ter sleep down-stairs in the room straight under this. (13) You are—you are!”

Pollyanna actually grew white. (14) “You mean—why, Nancy, not really—really and truly?”



“I guess you'll think it's really and truly,” prophesied Nancy, exultingly, nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she had taken from the closet. (15) “I'm told ter take down yer things, and I'm goin' ter take 'em, too, 'fore she gets a chance ter change her mind.”



Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence. (16) At the imminent risk of being dashed headlong, she was flying down-stairs, two steps at a time. (17) Bang went two doors and a chair before Pollyanna at last reached her goal—Aunt Polly. (18) “Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, did you mean it, really? (19) Why, that room's got EVERYTHING—the carpet and curtains and three pictures, besides the one outdoors, too, 'cause the windows look the same way. (20) Oh, Aunt Polly!”

“Very well, Pollyanna. (21) I am gratified that you like the change, of course; but if you think so much of all those things, I trust you will take proper care of them; that's all. (22) Pollyanna, please pick up that chair; and you have banged two doors in the last half-minute.” Miss Polly spoke sternly, all the more sternly because, for some inexplicable reason, she felt inclined to cry—and Miss Polly was not used to feeling inclined to cry. (23) Pollyanna picked up the chair. (24) “Yes'm; I know I banged 'em—those doors,” she admitted cheerfully. (25) “You see I'd just found out about the room, and I reckon you'd have banged doors if—” Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest. (26) “Aunt Polly, DID you ever bang doors?”

“I hope—not, Pollyanna!” Miss Polly's voice was properly shocked. (27) “Why, Aunt Polly, what a shame!” Pollyanna's face expressed only concerned sympathy. (28) “A shame!” repeated Aunt Polly, too dazed to say more. (29) “Why, yes.

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) There was a curious social situation in Black Hawk. (2) All the young men felt the attraction of the fine, well-set-up country girls who had come to town to earn a living, and, in nearly every case, to help the father struggle out of debt, or to make it possible for the younger children of the family to go to school. (3) Those girls had grown up in the first bitter-hard times, and had got little schooling themselves. (4) But the younger brothers and sisters, for whom they made such sacrifices and who have had ‘advantages,’ never seem to me, when I meet them now, half as interesting or as well educated. (5) The older girls, who helped to break up the wild sod, learned so much from life, from poverty, from their mothers and grandmothers; they had all, like Ántonia, been early awakened and made observant by coming at a tender age from an old country to a new. (6) I can remember a score of these country girls who were in service in Black Hawk during the few years I lived there, and I can remember something unusual and engaging about each of them. (7) Physically they were almost a race apart, and out-of-door work had given them a vigour which, when they got over their first shyness on coming to town, developed into a positive carriage and freedom of movement, and made them conspicuous among Black Hawk women. (8) That was before the day of high-school athletics. (9) Girls who had to walk more than half a mile to school were pitied. (10) There was not a tennis-court in the town; physical exercise was thought rather inelegant for the daughters of well-to-do families. (11) Some of the high-school girls were jolly and pretty, but they stayed indoors in winter because of the cold, and in summer because of the heat. (12) When one danced with them, their bodies never moved inside their clothes; their muscles seemed to ask but one thing—not to be disturbed. (13) I remember those girls merely as faces in the schoolroom, gay and rosy, or listless and dull, cut off below the shoulders, like cherubs, by the ink-smeared tops of the high desks that were surely put there to make us round-shouldered and hollow-chested. (14) The daughters of Black Hawk merchants had a confident, unenquiring belief that they were ‘refined,’ and that the country girls, who ‘worked out,’ were not. (15) The American farmers in our county were quite as hard-pressed as their neighbours from other countries. (16) All alike had come to Nebraska with little capital and no knowledge of the soil they must subdue. (17) All had borrowed money on their land. (18) But no matter in what straits the Pennsylvanian or Virginian found himself, he would not let his daughters go out into service. (19) Unless his girls could teach a country school, they sat at home in poverty. (20) The Bohemian and Scandinavian girls could not get positions as teachers, because they had had no opportunity to learn the language. (21) Determined to help in the struggle to clear the homestead from debt, they had no alternative but to go into service. (22) Some of them, after they came to town, remained as serious and as discreet in behaviour as they had been when they ploughed and herded on their father’s farm. (23) Others, like the three Bohemian Marys, tried to make up for the years of youth they had lost. (24) But every one of them did what she had set out to do, and sent home those hard-earned dollars. (25) The girls I knew were always helping to pay for ploughs and reapers, brood-sows, or steers to fatten. (26) One result of this family solidarity was that the foreign farmers in our county were the first to become prosperous. (27) After the fathers were out of debt, the daughters married the sons of neighbours—usually of like nationality—and the girls who once worked in Black Hawk kitchens are to-day managing big farms and fine families of their own; their children are better off than the children of the town women they used to serve. (28) I thought the attitude of the town people toward these girls very stupid.

Book Title: Just—William

Book Author: Richmal Crompton

Paragraph: (1) “I hope,” said the father at lunch, “that they’ve taken away that infernal machine of yours.”



William replied sadly that they had. (2) He addedthat some people didn’t seem to think it was stealing to take other people’s things. (3) “Then we may look forward to a little peace this evening?” said the father politely. (4) “Not that it matters to me, as I’m going out to dinner. (5) The only thing that relieves the tedium of going out to dinner is the fact that for a short time one has a rest from William.”



William acknowledged the compliment by a scowl and a mysterious muttered remark to the effect that some people were always at him. (6) During preparation in afternoon school he read a story-book kindly lent him by his next-door neighbour. (7) It was not because he had no work to do that William read a story-book in preparation. (8) It was a mark of defiance to the world in general. (9) It was also a very interesting story-book. (10) It opened with the hero as a small boy misunderstood and ill-treated by everyone around him. (11) Then he ran away. (12) He went to sea, and in a few years made an immense fortune in the goldfields. (13) He returned in the last chapter and forgave his family and presented them with a noble mansion and several shiploads of gold. (14) The idea impressed William—all except the end part. (15) He thought he’d prefer to have the noble mansion himself and pay rare visits to his family, during which he would listen to their humble apologies, and perhaps give them a nugget or two, but not very much—certainly not much to Ethel. (16) He wasn’t sure whether he’d ever really forgive them. (17) He’d have rooms full of squeaky balloons and trumpets in his house anyway, and he’d keep caterpillars and white rats all over the place too—things they made such afuss about in their old house—and he’d always go about in dirty boots, and he’d never brush his hair or wash, and he’d keep dozens of motor-cars, and he wouldn’t let Ethel go out in any of them. (18) He was roused from this enthralling day-dream by the discovery and confiscation of his story-book by the master in charge, and the subsequent fury of its owner. (19) In order adequately to express his annoyance, he dropped a little ball of blotting-paper soaked in ink down William’s back. (20) William, on attempting retaliation, was sentenced to stay in half an hour after school. (21) He returned gloomily to his history book (upside down) and his misanthropic view of life. (22) He compared himself bitterly with the hero of the story-book and decided not to waste another moment of his life in uncongenial surroundings. (23) He made a firm determination to run away as soon as he was released from school. (24) He walked briskly down the road away from the village. (25) In his pocket reposed the balloon. (26) He had made the cheering discovery that the mathematics master had left it on his desk, so he had joyfully taken it again into his possession. (27) He thought he might reach the coast before night, and get to the goldfields before next week. (28) He didn’t suppose it took long to make a fortune there. (29) He might be back before next Christmas and—crumbs!

Book Title: My Ántonia

Book Author: Willa Cather

Paragraph: (1) Let her alone.’



At a look from grandfather, Fuchs and Jelinek placed the lid on the box, and began to nail it down over Mr. Shimerda. (2) I was afraid to look at Ántonia. (3) She put her arms round Yulka and held the little girl close to her. (4) The coffin was put into the wagon. (5) We drove slowly away, against the fine, icy snow which cut our faces like a sand-blast. (6) When we reached the grave, it looked a very little spot in that snow-covered waste. (7) The men took the coffin to the edge of the hole and lowered it with ropes. (8) We stood about watching them, and the powdery snow lay without melting on the caps and shoulders of the men and the shawls of the women. (9) Jelinek spoke in a persuasive tone to Mrs. Shimerda, and then turned to grandfather. (10) ‘She says, Mr. (11) Burden, she is very glad if you can make some prayer for him here in English, for the neighbours to understand.’



Grandmother looked anxiously at grandfather. (12) He took off his hat, and the other men did likewise. (13) I thought his prayer remarkable. (14) I still remember it. (15) He began, ‘Oh, great and just God, no man among us knows what the sleeper knows, nor is it for us to judge what lies between him and Thee.’ He prayed that if any man there had been remiss toward the stranger come to a far country, God would forgive him and soften his heart. (16) He recalled the promises to the widow and the fatherless, and asked God to smooth the way before this widow and her children, and to ‘incline the hearts of men to deal justly with her.’ In closing, he said we were leaving Mr. Shimerda at ‘Thy judgment seat, which is also Thy mercy seat.’



All the time he was praying, grandmother watched him through the black fingers of her glove, and when he said ‘Amen,’ I thought she looked satisfied with him. (17) She turned to Otto and whispered, ‘Can’t you start a hymn, Fuchs? (18) It would seem less heathenish.’

Fuchs glanced about to see if there was general approval of her suggestion, then began, ‘Jesus, Lover of my Soul,’ and all the men and women took it up after him. (19) Whenever I have heard the hymn since, it has made me remember that white waste and the little group of people; and the bluish air, full of fine, eddying snow, like long veils flying:



‘While the nearer waters roll, While the tempest still is high.’



Years afterward, when the open-grazing days were over, and the red grass had been ploughed under and under until it had almost disappeared from the prairie; when all the fields were under fence, and the roads no longer ran about like wild things, but followed the surveyed section-lines, Mr. Shimerda’s grave was still there, with a sagging wire fence around it, and an unpainted wooden cross. (20) As grandfather had predicted, Mrs. Shimerda never saw the roads going over his head. (21) The road from the north curved a little to the east just there, and the road from the west swung out a little to the south; so that the grave, with its tall red grass that was never mowed, was like a little island; and at twilight, under a new moon or the clear evening star, the dusty roads used to look like soft grey rivers flowing past it. (22) I never came upon the place without emotion, and in all that country it was the spot most dear to me. (23) I loved the dim superstition, the propitiatory intent, that had put the grave there; and still more I loved the spirit that could not carry out the sentence—the error from the surveyed lines, the clemency of the soft earth roads along which the home-coming wagons rattled after sunset. (24) Never a tired driver passed the wooden cross, I am sure, without wishing well to the sleeper.

Book Title: Pollyanna

Book Author: Eleanor H. Porter

Paragraph: (1) She did not offer her hand, however, and her face was coldly reserved. (2) “I called to ask for—Pollyanna,” he began at once, a little brusquely. (3) “Thank you. (4) She is about the same,” said Miss Polly. (5) “And that is—won't you tell me HOW she is?” His voice was not quite steady this time. (6) A quick spasm of pain crossed the woman's face. (7) “I can't, I wish I could!”

“You mean—you don't know?”



“Yes.”



“But—the doctor?”



“Dr. (8) Warren himself seems—at sea. (9) He is in correspondence now with a New York specialist. (10) They have arranged for a consultation at once.”

“But—but what WERE her injuries that you do know?”



“A slight cut on the head, one or two bruises, and—and an injury to the spine which has seemed to cause—paralysis from the hips down.”



A low cry came from the man. (11) There was a brief silence; then, huskily, he asked:



“And Pollyanna—how does she—take it?”



“She doesn't understand—at all—how things really are. (12) And I CAN'T tell her.”

“But she must know—something!”



Miss Polly lifted her hand to the collar at her throat in the gesture that had become so common to her of late. (13) “Oh, yes. (14) She knows she can't—move; but she thinks her legs are—broken. (15) She says she's glad it's broken legs like yours rather than 'lifelong-invalids' like Mrs. (16) Snow's; because broken legs get well, and the other—doesn't. (17) She talks like that all the time, until it—it seems as if I should—die!”



Through the blur of tears in his own eyes, the man saw the drawn face opposite, twisted with emotion. (18) Involuntarily his thoughts went back to what Pollyanna had said when he had made his final plea for her presence: “Oh, I couldn't leave Aunt Polly—now!”



It was this thought that made him ask very gently, as soon as he could control his voice:



“I wonder if you know, Miss Harrington, how hard I tried to get Pollyanna to come and live with me.”



“With YOU! (19) Pollyanna!”

The man winced a little at the tone of her voice; but his own voice was still impersonally cool when he spoke again. (20) “Yes. (21) I wanted to adopt her—legally, you understand; making her my heir, of course.”



The woman in the opposite chair relaxed a little. (22) It came to her, suddenly, what a brilliant future it would have meant for Pollyanna—this adoption; and she wondered if Pollyanna were old enough and mercenary enough—to be tempted by this man's money and position. (23) “I am very fond of Pollyanna,” the man was continuing. (24) “I am fond of her both for her own sake, and for—her mother's. (25) I stood ready to give Pollyanna the love that had been twenty-five years in storage.”



“LOVE.” Miss Polly remembered suddenly why SHE had taken this child in the first place—and with the recollection came the remembrance of Pollyanna's own words uttered that very morning: “I love to be called 'dear' by folks that belong to you!” And it was this love-hungry little girl that had been offered the stored-up affection of twenty-five years:—and she was old enough to be tempted by love! (26) With a sinking heart Miss Polly realized that. (27) With a sinking heart, too, she realized something else: the dreariness of her own future now without Pollyanna. (28) “Well?” she said. (29) And the man, recognizing the self-control that vibrated through the harshness of the tone, smiled sadly. (30) “She would not come,” he answered.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) The children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons. (2) He that ate fastest got most; he that was strongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied. (3) I was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. (4) I left it with joy. (5) I shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master (Anthony) had determined to let me go to Baltimore, to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, brother to my old master’s son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld. (6) I received this information about three days before my departure. (7) They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed. (8) I spent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing myself for my departure. (9) The pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. (10) I spent the time in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because Mrs. Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore; for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty. (11) Besides, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me. (12) The thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed! (13) It was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin itself. (14) I went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hope of reward. (15) The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case. (16) I found no severe trial in my departure. (17) My home was charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying. (18) My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her. (19) I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. (20) I looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving. (21) If, however, I found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying. (22) Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb, that “being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. (23) Cousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place. (24) I could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him. (25) Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore. (26) So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange. (27) I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness. (28) We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. (29) I remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month, nor the months of the year.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) Just then back came theTrollpuffing and blowing and tearing along. (2) He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. (3) So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:



“, what a smell of Christian man’s blood!”



That very momentHalvorhewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of workHalvorhad to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it. (4) So all thePrincessescame together to that Castle, which was calledSoria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before,and they all were fond ofHalvorandHalvorof them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three. (5) But there after a while,Halvorwent about, and was so strange and dull and silent. (6) Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn’t like to live with them any longer? (7) Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see. (8) Well, they thought that might be done easily enough. (9) “You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,” said thePrincesses. (10) Yes, he’d be sure to mind all they said. (11) So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king’s son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he’d never see them more. (12) “If I only stood at home I’d be glad,” saidHalvor; and it was done as he had wished. (13) Then stoodHalvorat his father’s cottage door before he knew a word about it. (14) Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape. (15) ThenHalvorasked if he couldn’t stay there, and have a lodging there that night. (16) No; that he couldn’t. (17) “We can’t do it at all,” they said, “for we haven’t this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; ’twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything.”



Halvorwouldn’t hear of it—he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer’s; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn’t even a chair to offer him to sit down on. (18) “No,” saidHalvor, “I won’t go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner.”



Well, they couldn’t say anything against that; soHalvorsat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones. (19) Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they toldHalvorabout this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children. (20) Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name wasHalvor, but they didn’t know whither he had wandered; they couldn’t even tell whether he were dead or alive. (21) “Couldn’t it be me, now?” saidHalvor. (22) “Let me see; I could tell him well enough,” said the old wife, and rose up. (23) “OurHalvorwas so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. (24) No;there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master.”



A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell onHalvor’sface, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once. (25) “Ah! (26) but it is you after all,Halvor?” she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer’s, and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him. (27) And off she went first, andHalvorfollowed after. (28) So, when she got up there, she told them all howHalvorhad come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, “he looks like nothing but a King’s son.”



“All very fine,” said the lassies, and tossed up their heads. (29) “We’ll be bound he’s just the same beggarly ragged boy he always was.”



Just then in walkedHalvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran outin their smocks. (30) Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look atHalvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty.

Book Title: Mrs. Dalloway

Book Author: Virginia Woolf

Paragraph: (1) was utterly free—as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding. (2) I haven’t felt so young for years! (3) thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so) from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window. (4) But she’s extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon’s statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought (susceptible as he was), to shed veilafter veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting. (5) Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket-knife he started after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them, which singled him out, as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts. (6) “You,” she said, only “you,” saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders. (7) Then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past Dent’s shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness, a mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the tired—



But she’s not married; she’s young; quite young, thought Peter, the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar Square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red. (8) But she waited at the kerbstone. (9) There was a dignity about her. (10) She was not worldly, like Clarissa; not rich, like Clarissa. (11) Was she, he wondered as she moved, respectable? (12) Witty, with a lizard’s flickering tongue, he thought (for one must invent, mustallow oneself a little diversion), a cool waiting wit, a darting wit; not noisy. (13) She moved; she crossed; he followed her. (14) To embarrass her was the last thing he wished. (15) Still if she stopped he would say “Come and have an ice,” he would say, and she would answer, perfectly simply, “Oh yes.”



But other people got between them in the street, obstructing him, blotting her out. (16) He pursued; she changed. (17) There was colour in her cheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from India) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned proprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the shop windows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats. (18) He was a buccaneer. (19) On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness. (20) Laughing and delightful, she had crossed OxfordStreet and Great Portland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now, and now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened, opened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him, one look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the door, and gone! (21) Clarissa’s voice saying, Remember my party, Remember my party, sang in his ears. (22) The house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower-baskets of vague impropriety. (23) It was over. (24) Well, I’ve had my fun; I’ve had it, he thought, looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums. (25) And it was smashed to atoms—his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of life, he thought—making oneself up; making her up; creating an exquisite amusement, and something more. (26) But odd it was, and quite true; all this one could never share—it smashed to atoms. (27) He turned; went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit, till it was time for Lincoln’s Inn—for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley. (28) Where should he go? (29) No matter. (30) Up the street, then, towardsRegent’s Park.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) Mr. Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr. Shaw in Newport, and told me, in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, we were so anxious to get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage, and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford. (2) We were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber. (3) They seemed at once to understand our circumstances, and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence. (4) It was good indeed to meet with such friends, at such a time. (5) Upon reaching New Bedford, we were directed to the house of Mr. Nathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitably provided for. (6) Both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare. (7) They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists. (8) When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare, he held on upon our baggage as security for the debt. (9) I had but to mention the fact to Mr. Johnson, and he forthwith advanced the money. (10) We now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom. (11) On the morning after our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the question arose as to what name I should be called by. (12) The name given me by my mother was, “Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.” I, however, had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of “Frederick Bailey.” I started from Baltimore bearing the name of “Stanley.” When I got to New York, I again changed my name to “Frederick Johnson,” and thought that would be the last change. (13) But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary again to change my name. (14) The reason of this necessity was, that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them. (15) I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of “Frederick.” I must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my identity. (16) Mr. Johnson had just been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and at once suggested that my name be “Douglass.” From that time until now I have been called “Frederick Douglass;” and as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it as my own. (17) I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford. (18) The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous. (19) I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south. (20) I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves. (21) I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south. (22) I knewtheywere exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders. (23) I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement. (24) And upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. (25) Such being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake. (26) In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping. (27) Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth. (28) Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size. (29) Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life. (30) Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark. (2) My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather. (3) My father was a white man. (4) He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage. (5) The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. (6) My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as my mother. (7) It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. (8) Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor. (9) For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child’s affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child. (10) This is the inevitable result. (11) I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night. (12) She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home. (13) She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her day’s work. (14) She was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary—a permission which they seldom get, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master. (15) I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. (16) She was with me in the night. (17) She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone. (18) Very little communication ever took place between us. (19) Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and with it her hardships and suffering. (20) She died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master’s farms, near Lee’s Mill. (21) I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death, or burial. (22) She was gone long before I knew any thing about it. (23) Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger. (24) Called thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was. (25) The whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father. (26) I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others. (27) They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress. (28) She is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves. (29) The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and, cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down to his parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.

Book Title: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave

Book Author: Frederick Douglass

Paragraph: (1) These holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. (2) But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors! (3) I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake. (4) The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity of slavery. (5) They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave. (6) They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. (7) This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning. (8) Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. (9) For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk. (10) One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. (11) Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty. (12) The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. (13) We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum. (14) So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,—feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery. (15) I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery. (16) It is so. (17) The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things. (18) For instance, a slave loves molasses; he steals some. (19) His master, in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it. (20) The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance. (21) A slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. (22) His master is enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given time. (23) Then, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to please! (24) I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have cited sufficient. (25) The practice is a very common one. (26) On the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. (27) Covey, and went to live with Mr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael’s. (28) I soon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. (29) Covey. (30) Though not rich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) But before he went, he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life. (2) Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but then he couldn’t hold out any longer; he must and would go into that room, and so in he stole. (3) There stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself, with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss of hay at his tail. (4) Then the lad thought this all wrong, so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head. (5) Then said theHorse:

“Since you are so good at heart as to let me have some food, I’ll set you free, that I will. (6) For if theTrollcomes back and finds you here, he’ll kill you outright. (7) But now you must go up to the room which lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don’t take any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you see, that’s the one to take; and sword and saddle you must choose for yourself just in the same way.”



So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once. (8) When he came back, theHorsetold him to pull off his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. (9) “If I do,” thought the lad, “I shall look an awful fright;” but for all that, he did as he was told. (10) So when he had taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger than he had been before. (11) “Do you feel any change?” asked theHorse. (12) “Yes,” said the lad. (13) “Try and lift me, then,” said theHorse. (14) Oh yes! (15) he could do that, and as for the sword, he brandished it like a feather. (16) “Now saddle me,” said theHorse, “and put on the coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of ointment, and then we’ll be off as fast as we can.”



So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went at such a rate, he couldn’t at all tell how they went. (17) But when he had ridden awhile, theHorsesaid, “I think I hear a noise; look round! (18) can you see anything?”

“Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at least a score,” said the lad. (19) “Aye, aye, that’s theTrollcoming,” said theHorse; “now he’s after us with his pack.”



So they rode on a while, until those who followed were close behind them. (20) “Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you, over your shoulder,” said theHorse; “but mind you throw it a good way off my back.”



So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick bramblewood grew up behind them. (21) So the lad rode on a long, long time, while theTrolland his crew had to go home to fetch something to hew their way through the wood. (22) But at last theHorsesaidagain:

“Look behind you! (23) can you see anything now?”

“Yes, ever so many,” said the lad, “as many as would fill a large church.”



“Aye, aye, that’s theTrolland his crew,” said theHorse; “now he’s got more to back him; but now throw down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me.”



And as soon as the lad did what theHorsesaid, up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. (24) So theTrollhad to be off home to fetch something to mine his waythrough the rock; and while theTrolldid that, the lad rode a good bit further on. (25) But still theHorsebegged him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams. (26) But still the Horse begged him to look behind him. (27) “Aye, aye,” said theHorse, “that’s theTroll, and now he’s got his whole band with him, so throw the pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don’t spill any of it upon me.”



So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse’s flank. (28) So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. (29) But when theTrollscame to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst.

Book Title: East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North

Book Author: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen

Paragraph: (1) on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for theKing’stable. (2) One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. (3) Do what he would—however he tried with bait and angle—there was never a sprat on his hook. (4) But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:



“If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough.”



So the man answered boldly, “Yes;” for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. (5) Afterthat, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. (6) But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, “I bear a babe under my girdle.”



Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the castle; and when theKingheard the woman’s grief and its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the child, and see if he couldn’t save it. (7) So the months went on and on, and when her time came the fisher’s wife had a boy; so the king took it at once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad grew up. (8) Then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he said. (9) At first theKingwouldn’t hear of it, but at last the lad had his way, and went. (10) So he and his father were out the whole day, and all went right and well till they landed at night. (11) Then the lad remembered he had left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off with him at such speed that the water roared under the bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it withthe oars was no use; so he went and went the whole night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away. (12) There he went ashore, and when he had walked about a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard. (13) “What’s the name of this land?” asked the lad. (14) “Whiteland,” said the man, who went on to ask the lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. (15) So the lad told him all. (16) “You’ll come to three Princesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out.”



“Aye, aye!” said the man; “now when you have walked a little farther along the strand here, you’ll come to threePrincesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. (17) Then the first—she is the eldest—will call out and beg you so prettily to come and help her; and the second will do the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything. (18) But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks. (19) If you do this, you’ll have good luck—that’s all.”



When the lad came to the firstPrincess, she called out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her, but he passed on as though he saw her not. (20) In the same way he passed by the second; but to the third he went straight up. (21) “If you’ll do what I bid you,” she said, “you may have which of us you please.”



“Yes;” he was willing enough; so she told him how threeTrollshad set them down in the earth there; but before they had lived in the castle up among the trees. (22) “Now,” she said, “you must go into that castle, and let theTrollswhip you each one night for each of us. (23) If you can bear that, you’ll set us free.”

Well, the lad said he was ready to try. (24) “When you go in,” thePrincesswent on to say, “you’ll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you’ll only go right in the middle between them they’ll do you no harm.
