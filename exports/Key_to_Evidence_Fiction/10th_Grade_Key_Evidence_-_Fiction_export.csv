Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) If we all did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a Republic of the Virtues. (2) He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. (3) He never did anything else in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back again. (4) When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively must find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates. (5) “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”



If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning. (6) I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours. (7) As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll. (8) At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our humour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—



“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”



“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.”



“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”



We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose. (9) I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. (10) And I know Herbert thought so too. (11) We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark. (12) Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. (13) For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery. (14) I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’s Inn and the date very carefully added. (15) Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of Herbert’s debts.”



Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged. (16) The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. (17) In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal. (18) When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on? (19) Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures. (20) “They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they are mounting up.”



“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity. (21) “Look the thing in the face. (22) Look into your affairs. (23) Stare them out of countenance.”

“So I would, Handel, only they are staringmeout of countenance.”



However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would fall to work again. (24) After a time he would give up once more, on the plea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as the case might be. (25) “Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.”



“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with admiration. (26) “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”



I thought so too. (27) I established with myself, on these occasions, the reputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed. (28) When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. (29) My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. (30) When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle.

Book Title: Persuasion

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.”



After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say—



“In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant. (2) Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands. (3) Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights. (4) I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.”



Here Anne spoke—



“The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give. (5) Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.”



“Very true, very true. (6) What Miss Anne says, is very true,” was Mr Shepherd’s rejoinder, and “Oh! (7) certainly,” was his daughter’s; but Sir Walter’s remark was, soon afterwards—



“The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.”



“Indeed!” was the reply, and with a look of surprise. (8) “Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it. (9) First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man’s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man. (10) I have observed it all my life. (11) A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line. (12) One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. (13) ‘In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?’ said I to a friend of mine who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley). (14) ‘Old fellow!’ cried Sir Basil, ‘it is Admiral Baldwin. (15) What do you take his age to be?’ ‘Sixty,’ said I, ‘or perhaps sixty-two.’ ‘Forty,’ replied Sir Basil, ‘forty, and no more.’ Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin. (16) I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen. (17) It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin’s age.”



“Nay, Sir Walter,” cried Mrs Clay, “this is being severe indeed. (18) Have a little mercy on the poor men. (19) We are not all born to be handsome. (20) The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth. (21) But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other? (22) Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man’s looks to the natural effect of time. (23) The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman—” she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;—“and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere. (24) In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is onlytheirlot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.”



It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter’s good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent. (25) By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing—(it was just as he had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter’s concerns could not be kept a secret,)—accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd’s) connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant. (26) “And who is Admiral Croft?” was Sir Walter’s cold suspicious inquiry. (27) Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman’s family, and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed, added—



“He is a rear admiral of the white. (28) He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years.”



“Then I take it for granted,” observed Sir Walter, “that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.”



Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman. (29) Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral’s family, which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant. (30) He was a married man, and without children; the very state to be wished for.

Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’s purse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away. (2) Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed. (3) “What place is that?” Estella asked me. (4) I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told her. (5) As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring, “Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration. (6) “Mr. (7) Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, “has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London.”



“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a low voice. (8) “You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”



“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I can remember. (9) But I know him no better now, than I did before I could speak plainly. (10) What is your own experience of him? (11) Do you advance with him?”

“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very well.”



“Are you intimate?”



“I have dined with him at his private house.”



“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”



“It is a curious place.”



I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas. (12) It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning. (13) So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this side of it, and what on that. (14) The great city was almost new to her, she told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until she had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning. (15) I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here? (16) To that she emphatically said “God forbid!” and no more. (17) It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me; that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task had needed pains. (18) Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away. (19) When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see her sometimes. (20) “O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”



I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of? (21) “No; there are only two; mother and daughter. (22) The mother is a lady of some station, though not averse to increasing her income.”



“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”



“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, with a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are nearly all mine now.”



It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. (23) Of course she did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up. (24) We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house by the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a time. (25) Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest. (26) A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella. (27) The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she gave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed likewise. (28) And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy with her, but always miserable. (29) I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache.

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as fast as possible. (2) ""I meant the first dance. (3) May I have the honor?"". (4) ""I can give you one if I put off the Count. (5) He dances divinely; but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend,"" said Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be trifled with. (6) ""Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support



""'A daughter of the gods,



Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,'""



was all the satisfaction she got, however. (7) The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon, feeling all the while as if she could dance the Tarantula with a relish. (8) Laurie resigned her to the ""nice little boy,"" and went to do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence. (9) She showed him her ball-book with demure satisfaction when he strolled, instead of rushing, up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka-redowa; but his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she gallopaded away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief. (10) That was unpardonable; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while, except a word now and then, when she came to her chaperon, between the dances, for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. (11) Her anger had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. (12) Laurie's eyes followed her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. (13) He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view; and, before the evening was half over, had decided that ""little Amy was going to make a very charming woman."". (14) It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of every one, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light. (15) The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it; everybody danced who could, and those who couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. (16) The air was dark with Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes. (17) The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a dashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train. (18) The Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed thegarçonsby the ravages he committed. (19) But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. (20) The boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold; for, though he ""carried weight,"" he danced like an india-rubber ball. (21) He ran, he flew, he pranced; his face glowed, his bald head shone; his coat-tails waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow-men like a French Pickwick without glasses. (22) Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm, but more graceful agility; and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. (23) When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances that he was ""desolated to leave so early,"" she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment. (24) It had been successful; for, at three-and-twenty, blighted affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. (25) Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat; and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile,—



""Ah, I thought that would do him good!"". (26) ""You look like Balzac's 'Femme peinte par elle-même,'"" he said, as he fanned her with one hand, and held her coffee-cup in the other. (27) ""My rouge won't come off;"" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright. (28) ""What do you call this stuff?"". (29) he asked, touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee. (30) ""Illusion. (31) "".

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) She was friendly enough with Emma Jane and Rebecca, but grew less and less intimate as time went on. (2) She was extremely pretty, with a profusion of auburn hair, and a few very tiny freckles, to which she constantly alluded, as no one could possibly detect them without noting her porcelain skin and her curling lashes. (3) She had merry eyes, a somewhat too plump figure for her years, and was popularly supposed to have a fascinating way with her. (4) Riverboro being poorly furnished with beaux, she intended to have as good a time during her four years at Wareham as circumstances would permit. (5) Her idea of pleasure was an ever-changing circle of admirers to fetch and carry for her, the more publicly the better; incessant chaff and laughter and vivacious conversation, made eloquent and effective by arch looks and telling glances. (6) She had a habit of confiding her conquests to less fortunate girls and bewailing the incessant havoc and damage she was doing; a damage she avowed herself as innocent of, in intention, as any new-born lamb. (7) It does not take much of this sort of thing to wreck an ordinary friendship, so before long Rebecca and Emma Jane sat in one end of the railway train in going to and from Riverboro, and Huldah occupied the other with her court. (8) Sometimes this was brilliant beyond words, including a certain youthful Monte Cristo, who on Fridays expended thirty cents on a round trip ticket and traveled from Wareham to Riverboro merely to be near Huldah; sometimes, too, the circle was reduced to the popcorn-and-peanut boy of the train, who seemed to serve every purpose in default of better game. (9) Rebecca was in the normally unconscious state that belonged to her years; boys were good comrades, but no more; she liked reciting in the same class with them, everything seemed to move better; but from vulgar and precocious flirtations she was protected by her ideals. (10) There was little in the lads she had met thus far to awaken her fancy, for it habitually fed on better meat. (11) Huldah's school-girl romances, with their wealth of commonplace detail, were not the stuff her dreams were made of, when dreams did flutter across the sensitive plate of her mind. (12) Among the teachers at Wareham was one who influenced Rebecca profoundly, Miss Emily Maxwell, with whom she studied English literature and composition. (13) Miss Maxwell, as the niece of one of Maine's ex-governors and the daughter of one of Bowdoin's professors, was the most remarkable personality in Wareham, and that her few years of teaching happened to be in Rebecca's time was the happiest of all chances. (14) There was no indecision or delay in the establishment of their relations; Rebecca's heart flew like an arrow to its mark, and her mind, meeting its superior, settled at once into an abiding attitude of respectful homage. (15) It was rumored that Miss Maxwell ""wrote,"" which word, when uttered in a certain tone, was understood to mean not that a person had command of penmanship, Spencerian or otherwise, but that she had appeared in print. (16) ""You'll like her; she writes,"" whispered Huldah to Rebecca the first morning at prayers, where the faculty sat in an imposing row on the front seats. (17) ""She writes; and I call her stuck up."". (18) Nobody seemed possessed of exact information with which to satisfy the hungry mind, but there was believed to be at least one person in existence who had seen, with his own eyes, an essay by Miss Maxwell in a magazine. (19) This height of achievement made Rebecca somewhat shy of her, but she looked her admiration; something that most of the class could never do with the unsatisfactory organs of vision given them by Mother Nature. (20) Miss Maxwell's glance was always meeting a pair of eager dark eyes; when she said anything particularly good, she looked for approval to the corner of the second bench, where every shade of feeling she wished to evoke was reflected on a certain sensitive young face. (21) One day, when the first essay of the class was under discussion, she asked each new pupil to bring her some composition written during the year before, that she might judge the work, and know precisely with what material she had to deal. (22) Rebecca lingered after the others, and approached the desk shyly. (23) ""I haven't any compositions here, Miss Maxwell, but I can find one when I go home on Friday. (24) They are packed away in a box in the attic."". (25) ""Carefully tied with pink and blue ribbons?"". (26) asked Miss Maxwell, with a whimsical smile. (27) ""No,"" answered Rebecca, shaking her head decidedly; ""I wanted to use ribbons, because all the other girls did, and they looked so pretty, but I used to tie my essays with twine strings on purpose; and the one on solitude I fastened with an old shoelacing just to show it what I thought of it!"". (28) ""Solitude!"". (29) laughed Miss Maxwell, raising her eyebrows. (30) ""Did you choose your own subject? (31) "".

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) Now eat your breakfast, Rebecca, and after we've done the dishes you can run over to Emma's and give her her chain—What's the matter, child?"". (2) Rebecca's emotions seemed always to be stored, as it were, in adjoining compartments, and to be continually getting mixed. (3) At this moment, though her joy was too deep for words, her bread and butter almost choked her, and at intervals a tear stole furtively down her cheek. (4) Mr. Ladd called as he promised, and made the acquaintance of the aunts, understanding them both in five minutes as well as if he had known them for years. (5) On a footstool near the open fire sat Rebecca, silent and shy, so conscious of her fine apparel and the presence of aunt Miranda that she could not utter a word. (6) It was one of her ""beauty days."". (7) Happiness, excitement, the color of the green dress, and the touch of lovely pink in the coral necklace had transformed the little brown wren for the time into a bird of plumage, and Adam Ladd watched her with evident satisfaction. (8) Then there was the sleigh ride, during which she found her tongue and chattered like any magpie, and so ended that glorious Christmas Day; and many and many a night thereafter did Rebecca go to sleep with the precious coral chain under her pillow, one hand always upon it to be certain that it was safe. (9) Another milestone was the departure of the Simpsons from Riverboro, bag and baggage, the banquet lamp being their most conspicuous possession. (10) It was delightful to be rid of Seesaw's hateful presence; but otherwise the loss of several playmates at one fell swoop made rather a gap in Riverboro's ""younger set,"" and Rebecca was obliged to make friends with the Robinson baby, he being the only long-clothes child in the village that winter. (11) The faithful Seesaw had called at the side door of the brick house on the evening before his departure, and when Rebecca answered his knock, stammered solemnly, ""Can I k-keep comp'ny with you when you g-g-row up?"". (12) ""Certainly NOT,"" replied Rebecca, closing the door somewhat too speedily upon her precocious swain. (13) Mr. Simpson had come home in time to move his wife and children back to the town that had given them birth, a town by no means waiting with open arms to receive them. (14) The Simpsons' moving was presided over by the village authorities and somewhat anxiously watched by the entire neighborhood, but in spite of all precautions a pulpit chair, several kerosene lamps, and a small stove disappeared from the church and were successfully swapped in the course of Mr. Simpson's driving tour from the old home to the new. (15) It gave Rebecca and Emma Jane some hours of sorrow to learn that a certain village in the wake of Abner Simpson's line of progress had acquired, through the medium of an ambitious young minister, a magnificent lamp for its new church parlors. (16) No money changed hands in the operation; for the minister succeeded in getting the lamp in return for an old bicycle. (17) The only pleasant feature of the whole affair was that Mr. Simpson, wholly unable to console his offspring for the loss of the beloved object, mounted the bicycle and rode away on it, not to be seen or heard of again for many a long day. (18) The year was notable also as being the one in which Rebecca shot up like a young tree. (19) She had seemingly never grown an inch since she was ten years old, but once started she attended to growing precisely as she did other things,—with such energy, that Miss Jane did nothing for months but lengthen skirts, sleeves, and waists. (20) In spite of all the arts known to a thrifty New England woman, the limit of letting down and piecing down was reached at last, and the dresses were sent to Sunnybrook Farm to be made over for Jenny. (21) There was another milestone, a sad one, marking a little grave under a willow tree at Sunnybrook Farm. (22) Mira, the baby of the Randall family, died, and Rebecca went home for a fortnight's visit. (23) The sight of the small still shape that had been Mira, the baby who had been her special charge ever since her birth, woke into being a host of new thoughts and wonderments; for it is sometimes the mystery of death that brings one to a consciousness of the still greater mystery of life. (24) It was a sorrowful home-coming for Rebecca. (25) The death of Mira, the absence of John, who had been her special comrade, the sadness of her mother, the isolation of the little house, and the pinching economies that went on within it, all conspired to depress a child who was so sensitive to beauty and harmony as Rebecca. (26) Hannah seemed to have grown into a woman during Rebecca's absence. (27) There had always been a strange unchildlike air about Hannah, but in certain ways she now appeared older than aunt Jane—soberer, and more settled. (28) She was pretty, though in a colorless fashion; pretty and capable. (29) Rebecca walked through all the old playgrounds and favorite haunts of her early childhood; all her familiar, her secret places; some of them known to John, some to herself alone. (30) There was the spot where the Indian pipes grew; the particular bit of marshy ground where the fringed gentians used to be largest and bluest; the rock maple where she found the oriole's nest; the hedge where the field mice lived; the moss-covered stump where the white toadstools were wont to spring up as if by magic; the hole at the root of the old pine where an ancient and honorable toad made his home; these were the landmarks of her childhood, and she looked at them as across an immeasurable distance.

Book Title: Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus

Book Author: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

Paragraph: (1) But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages. (2) At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. (3) Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. (4) It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it)keeping;and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. (5) Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. (6) Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. (7) My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. (8) He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. (9) I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. (10) The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. (11) This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. (12) A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. (13) I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. (14) This, briefly, is his story. (15) Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. (16) He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. (17) My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. (18) He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. (19) But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. (20) “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. (21) He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command. (22) Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. (23) Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. (24) The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. (25) I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. (26) I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. (27) It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. (28) I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. (29) I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) The meeting opened with the regular weekly “stunts.” Retiring President Vergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his voice like a brazen gong of festival. (2) Members who had brought guests introduced them publicly. (3) “This tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting editor of thePress,” said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the druggist, chanted, “Boys, when you’re on a long motor tour and finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, ‘This is certainly a romantic place,’ it sends a glow right up and down your vertebræ. (4) Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good Booster, goes marching on—”



There were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the “Bird of Paradise” company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater, and the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. (5) Lucas Prout. (6) Vergil Gunch thundered, “When we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses—and I got to admit I butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters appreciated the high-class artistic performance he’s giving us—and don’t forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will appreciate our patronage—and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor out of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we’ve done ourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties—”



By rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations, donated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the Jennifer Avenue florist. (7) Each week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to four fellow-members, chosen by lot. (8) Therewas laughter, this week, when it was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the undertaker. (9) Everybody whispered, “I can think of a coupla good guys to be buried if his donation is a free funeral!”



Through all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken croquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American cheese. (10) Gunch did not lump the speeches. (11) Presently he called on the visiting secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization. (12) The secretary had the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License Number 5. (13) The Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the state so low a number created a sensation, and “though it was pretty nice to have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn well, and sometimes he didn’t know but what he’d almost as soon have just plain B56,876 or something like that. (14) Only let any doggone Booster try to get Number 5 away from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the fur fly! (15) And if they’d permit him, he’d wind up by calling for a cheer for the Boosters and Rotarians and the Kiwanis all together!”



Babbitt sighed to Professor Pumphrey, “Be pretty nice to have as low a number as that! (16) Everybody’d say, ‘He must be an important guy!’ Wonder how he got it? (17) I’ll bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the Motor License Bureau to a fare-you-well!”



Then Chum Frink addressed them:



“Some of you may feel that it’s out of place here to talk on a strictly highbrow and artistic subject, but I want to come out flatfooted and ask you boys to O.K. (18) the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith. (19) Now, where a lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you don’t like classical music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it. (20) Now, I want to confess that, though I’m a literary guy by profession, I don’t care a rap for all this long-haired music. (21) I’d ratherlisten to a good jazz band any time than to some piece by Beethoven that hasn’t any more tune to it than a bunch of fighting cats, and you couldn’t whistle it to save your life! (22) But that isn’t the point. (23) Culture has become as necessary an adornment and advertisement for a city to-day as pavements or bank-clearances. (24) It’s Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so on, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every year and, to be frank, for all our splendid attainments we haven’t yet got the Culture of a New York or Chicago or Boston—or at least we don’t get the credit for it. (25) The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is tocapitalize Culture; to go right out and grab it. (26) “Pictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study ’em, but they don’t shoot out on the road and holler ‘This is what little old Zenith can put up in the way of Culture.’ That’s precisely what a Symphony Orchestra does do. (27) Look at the credit Minneapolis and Cincinnati get. (28) An orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell conductor—and I believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one of the highest-paid conductors on the market, providing he ain’t a Hun—it goes right into Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays at the best theaters to the most cultured and moneyed people; it gives such class-advertising as a town can get in no other way; and the guy who is so short-sighted as to crab this orchestra proposition is passing up the chance to impress the glorious name of Zenith on some big New York millionaire that might—that might establish a branch factory here! (29) “I could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an interest in highbrow music and may want to teach it, having an A1 local organization is of great benefit, but let’s keep this on a practical basis, and I call on you good brothers to whoop it up for Culture and a World-beating Symphony Orchestra!”



They applauded. (30) To a rustle of excitement President Gunch proclaimed, “Gentlemen, we will now proceed to the annual election of officers.” For each of the six offices, three candidates had been chosen by a committee.

Book Title: Persuasion

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you. (2) But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day. (3) What is her age? (4) Forty?”

“No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself. (5) She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.”



“But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?” asked Elizabeth. (6) “She sees nothing to blame in it,” replied Anne; “on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith.”



“Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,” observed Sir Walter. (7) “Sir Henry Russell’s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms, but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot. (8) A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings! (9) A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland! (10) Mrs Smith! (11) Such a name!”

Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence ofherfriend’s not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her. (12) She made no reply. (13) She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity. (14) Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening. (15) She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship’s service themselves, but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her. (16) Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell. (17) To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause. (18) Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot. (19) He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence. (20) He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create. (21) Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot. (22) She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing. (23) She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned. (24) Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head. (25) “I am no match-maker, as you well know,” said Lady Russell, “being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations. (26) I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together. (27) A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one.”



“Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him,” said Anne; “but we should not suit.”



Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, “I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother’s place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me. (28) You are your mother’s self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued! (29) My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!”



Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited. (30) For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, theJolly Roger, lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. (2) She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the horror of her name. (3) She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore. (4) There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. (5) I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. (6) Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious. (7) A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing. (8) Hook trod the deck in thought. (9) O man unfathomable. (10) It was his hour of triumph. (11) Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. (12) It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success? (13) But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind. (14) Hook was profoundly dejected. (15) He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night. (16) It was because he was so terribly alone. (17) This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. (18) They were socially inferior to him.

Book Title: Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus

Book Author: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

Paragraph: (1) The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. (2) All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. (3) Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. (4) The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage. (5) “I knocked. (6) ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. (7) ‘Come in.’

“I entered. (8) ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’



“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.’



“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.’



“I sat down, and a silence ensued. (9) I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me. (10) ‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?’



“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. (11) I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’



“‘Are they Germans?’



“‘No, they are French. (12) But let us change the subject. (13) I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth. (14) These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. (15) I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’



“‘Do not despair. (16) To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. (17) Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’



“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. (18) I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’



“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?’



“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. (19) I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’



“‘Where do these friends reside?’



“‘Near this spot.’



“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. (20) I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. (21) I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’



“‘Excellent man! (22) I thank you and accept your generous offer. (23) You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.’



“‘Heaven forbid! (24) Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. (25) I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’



“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? (26) From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’



“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’



“I paused. (27) This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. (28) I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. (29) At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) She was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip. (2) Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point. (3) She could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross. (4) Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back. (5) “I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was opened. (6) “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may sleep ten hours. (7) Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I came. (8) Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”



And he ran off down the corridor. (9) “What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted. (10) “He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room. (11) It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door. (12) Both women waited this time completely relying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov. (13) Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated condition. (14) But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle. (15) He stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria Alexandrovna. (16) He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation. (17) He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies. (18) Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. (19) All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction. (20) He declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. (21) According to his observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas... and so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme. (22) On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania—he, Zossimov, was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine—but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. (23) Then he got up, took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him. (24) He went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself. (25) “We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion, following Zossimov out. (26) “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.”



“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street. (27) “Fetching? (28) You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov and seized him by the throat. (29) “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. (2) Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? (3) Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode, and had capital times. (4) After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. (5) Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till tea-time. (6) The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two. (7) If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. (8) The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. (9) He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed; called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like a reprehensible old bird. (10) Then she could not endure the dog,—a fat, cross beast, who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back, with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. (11) The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady. (12) Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with ""Madame,"" as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. (13) Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. (14) She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much, with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. (15) She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests; for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. (16) Amy's chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeon-holes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. (17) To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on velvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. (18) There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding-day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends, and weeping willows made of hair inside; the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn; Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box, all by itself, lay Aunt March's wedding-ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away, like the most precious jewel of them all. (19) ""Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?"". (20) asked Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables. (21) ""I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. (22) I should choose this if I might,"" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads, from which hung a heavy cross of the same. (23) ""I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! (24) to me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic,"" said Esther, eying the handsome thing wistfully. (25) ""Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass?"". (26) asked Amy. (27) ""Truly, yes, to pray with. (28) It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou."". (29) ""You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. (30) I wish I could. (31) "".

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger. (2) The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. (3) Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night. (4) When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. (5) We shall see for whom she is looking presently. (6) The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. (7) Then quickly they will be on top of each other. (8) All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind. (9) This shows how real the island was. (10) The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. (11) They flung themselves down on the sward, close to their underground home. (12) “I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain. (13) “I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella.”



They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her. (14) It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by him as silly. (15) “All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one.”



While they talked they heard a distant sound. (16) You or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim song:



“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,The flag o’ skull and bones,A merry hour, a hempen rope,And hey for Davy Jones.”



At once the lost boys—but where are they? (17) They are no longer there. (18) Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly. (19) I will tell you where they are. (20) With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. (21) But how have they reached it? (22) for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. (23) Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. (24) These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. (25) Will he find it tonight? (26) As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. (27) But an iron claw gripped his shoulder. (28) “Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing. (29) Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. (30) It was a black voice.

Book Title: Persuasion

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others. (2) Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty. (3) Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day’s health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath. (4) “I cannot possibly do without Anne,” was Mary’s reasoning; and Elizabeth’s reply was, “Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.”



To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay. (5) This invitation of Mary’s removed all Lady Russell’s difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge. (6) So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs Clay’s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her. (7) Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay’s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore aggravation. (8) Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell. (9) With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father’s character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible. (10) She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind. (11) Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been. (12) Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister. (13) She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning. (14) She spoke, and seemed only to offend. (15) Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party’s perfectly knowing their situation. (16) “Mrs Clay,” said she, warmly, “never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people. (17) And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now. (18) If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy. (19) But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety. (20) One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. (21) That tooth of hers and those freckles. (22) Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him. (23) I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them. (24) You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay’s freckles.”



“There is hardly any personal defect,” replied Anne, “which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.”



“I think very differently,” answered Elizabeth, shortly; “an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones. (25) However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.”



Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good. (26) Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it. (27) The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter, Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. (28) The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week. (29) Her friend was not in better spirits than herself.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. (2) But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. (3) This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing. (4) The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. (5) You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. (6) When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally. (7) They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky. (8) He gave Wendy one of their combs. (9) The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. (10) She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. (11) The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst. (12) The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. (13) Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight. (14) But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. (15) Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. (16) This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland. (17) It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. (18) Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe.

Book Title: Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus

Book Author: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

Paragraph: (1) “I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. (2) But here also I am checked. (3) I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. (4) Did the murderer place it there? (5) I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? (6) “I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. (7) I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”



Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. (8) Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court. (9) “I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. (10) It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. (11) I am well acquainted with the accused. (12) I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. (13) During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. (14) She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. (15) She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. (16) For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. (17) She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.”



A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. (18) She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. (19) My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. (20) I believed in her innocence; I knew it. (21) Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? (22) I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. (23) The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold. (24) I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. (25) In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. (26) I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. (27) The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. (28) I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. (29) I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. (30) The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) They looked upon him bleakly and, after trying to appear at ease by examining his chin in the mirror, he gave it up and went out in silence. (2) “Just been making a trip through the South. (3) Business conditions not very good down there,” said one of the council. (4) “Is that a fact! (5) Not very good, eh?”

“No, didn’t strike me they were up to normal.”



“Not up to normal, eh?”



“No, I wouldn’t hardly say they were.”



The whole council nodded sagely and decided, “Yump, not hardly up to snuff.”



“Well, business conditions ain’t what they ought to be out West, neither, not by a long shot.”



“That’s a fact. (6) And I guess the hotel business feels it. (7) That’s one good thing, though: these hotels that’ve been charging five bucks a day—yes, and maybe six-seven! (8) for a rotten room are going to be darn glad to get four, and maybe give you a little service.”



“That’s a fact. (9) Say, uh, speaknubout hotels, I hit the St. Francis at San Francisco for the first time, the other day, and, say, it certainly is a first-class place.”



“You’re right, brother! (10) The St. Francis is a swell place—absolutely A1.”

“That’s a fact. (11) I’m right with you. (12) It’s a first-class place.”

“Yuh, but say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago? (13) I don’t want to knock— I believe in boosting wherever you can—but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass ’emselves off as first-class hotels, that’s the worst. (14) I’m going togetthose guys, one of these days, and I told ’em so. (15) You know how I am—well, maybe you don’t know, but I’m accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I’m perfectly willing to pay a reasonable price. (16) I got into Chicago late the other night, and the Rippleton’s near the station— I’d never been there before, but I says to the taxi-driver— I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it’s worth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs—and I said to him, ‘Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.’



“Well, we got there, and I breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk, ‘Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?’ Saaaay! (17) You’d ’a’ thought I’d sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! (18) He hands me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, ‘I dunno, friend, I’ll see,’ and he ducks behind the rigamajig they keep track of the rooms on. (19) Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was all right—he certainly took long enough—or maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him, and croaks, ‘I think I can let you have a room with bath.’ ‘Well, that’s awful nice of you—sorry to trouble you—how much’ll it set me back?’ I says, real sweet. (20) ‘It’ll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,’ he says. (21) “Well, it was late, and anyway, it went down on my expense-account—gosh, if I’d been paying it instead of the firm, I’d ’a’ tramped the streets all night before I’d ’a’ let any hick tavern stick me seven great big round dollars, believe me! (22) SoI lets it go at that. (23) Well, the clerk wakes a nice young bellhop—fine lad—not a day over seventy-nine years old—fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and doesn’t know it’s over yet—thought I was one of the Confederates, I guess, from the way he looked at me—and Rip van Winkle took me up to something— I found out afterwards they called it a room, but first I thought there’d been some mistake— I thought they were putting me in the Salvation Army collection-box! (24) At sevenpereach and everydiem! (25) Gosh!”

“Yuh, I’ve heard the Rippleton was pretty cheesy. (26) Now, when I go to Chicago I always stay at the Blackstone or the La Salle—first-class places.”



“Say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Birchdale at Terre Haute? (27) How is it?”

“Oh, the Birchdale is a first-class hotel.”



(Twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in South Bend, Flint, Dayton, Tulsa, Wichita, Fort Worth, Winona, Erie, Fargo, and Moose Jaw.) (28) “Speaknubout prices,” the man in the velour hat observed, fingering the elk-tooth on his heavy watch-chain, “I’d like to know where they get this stuff about clothes coming down. (29) Now, you take this suit I got on.” He pinched his trousers-leg. (30) “Four years ago I paid forty-two fifty for it, and it was real sure-’nough value.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon. (2) He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore. (3) Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper. (4) It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. (5) By working her wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted. (6) She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. (7) I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. (8) I can suppose only that, like Mrs. (9) Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth. (10) She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other’s language. (11) In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. (12) Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners. (13) “I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore, but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try to—swim—to—it.”



“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. (14) “Why don’t you let the nest drift as usual?”

“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over. (15) Then Peter tried slow and distinct. (16) “What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on. (17) The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers. (18) “You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I tell you?”



Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:



“So are you!”



Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:



“Shut up!”





“Shut up!”





Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. (19) Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear. (20) Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. (21) It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs. (22) There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. (23) The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers. (24) I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. (25) The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them. (26) The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. (27) Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. (28) It floated beautifully. (29) The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. (30) Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) “Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered. (2) “Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun. (3) “It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to Curly. (4) “I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly. (5) The first twin came to Peter. (6) “Father, we want to dance.”

“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour. (7) “But we want you to dance.”

Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be scandalised. (8) “Me! (9) My old bones would rattle!”

“And mummy too.”



“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”



“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated. (10) It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did it. (11) “Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting. (12) “People of our figure, Wendy!”

“But it is only among our own progeny.”



“True, true.”



So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first. (13) “Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”



“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified. (14) “Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”

“Michael takes after you.”



She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder. (15) “Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have now passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, do you?”



“No, Wendy.”



Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably, blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep. (16) “Peter, what is it?”

“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. (17) “It is only make-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”



“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly. (18) “You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old to be their real father.”



“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”



“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously. (19) “Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his sigh of relief. (20) “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are your exact feelings to me?”



“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”



“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room. (21) “You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just the same. (22) There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is not my mother.”



“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. (23) Now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins. (24) “Then what is it?”

“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”



“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. (25) “Perhaps Tinker Bell will tell me.”

“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. (26) “She is an abandoned little creature.”

Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent. (27) “She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted. (28) He had a sudden idea. (29) “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”

“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.

Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) t the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. (2) My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family. (3) Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,” laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill. (4) When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called “Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. (5) Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favoured with the employment. (6) In order, however, that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped. (7) I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure. (8) Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it. (9) She rented a small cottage, and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling. (10) There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. (11) What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony’s oration over the body of Caesar. (12) This was always followed by Collins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. (13) It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen. (14) Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept in the same room—a little general shop. (15) She had no idea what stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions. (16) Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. (17) She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. (18) She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. (19) This description must be received with a week-day limitation. (20) On Sundays, she went to church elaborated. (21) Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter. (22) After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition. (23) But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale. (24) One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. (25) I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. (26) With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle:—



“MIDEERJO iOPE UR KRWITEWELLiOPE iSHALSON BHABELL 4 2TEEDGEU JOANTHENWESHORL BSOGLODD ANWENi MPRENGTD 2UJOWOTLARXANBLEVE MEINFXNPIP.”



There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. (27) But I delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition. (28) “I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are! (29) An’t you?”

“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) Breakfast was not eaten in the kitchen, because it seemed worth while, now that there were three persons, to lay the cloth in the dining-room; it was also a more bountiful meal than of yore, when there was no child to consider. (2) The morning was made cheerful by Rebecca's start for school, the packing of the luncheon basket, the final word about umbrella, waterproof, or rubbers; the parting admonition and the unconscious waiting at the window for the last wave of the hand. (3) She found herself taking pride in Rebecca's improved appearance, her rounder throat and cheeks, and her better color; she was wont to mention the length of Rebecca's hair and add a word as to its remarkable evenness and lustre, at times when Mrs. Perkins grew too diffuse about Emma Jane's complexion. (4) She threw herself wholeheartedly on her niece's side when it became a question between a crimson or a brown linsey-woolsey dress, and went through a memorable struggle with her sister concerning the purchase of a red bird for Rebecca's black felt hat. (5) No one guessed the quiet pleasure that lay hidden in her heart when she watched the girl's dark head bent over her lessons at night, nor dreamed of her joy it, certain quiet evenings when Miranda went to prayer meeting; evenings when Rebecca would read aloud Hiawatha or Barbara Frietchie, The Bugle Song, or The Brook. (6) Her narrow, humdrum existence bloomed under the dews that fell from this fresh spirit; her dullness brightened under the kindling touch of the younger mind, took fire from the ""vital spark of heavenly flame"" that seemed always to radiate from Rebecca's presence. (7) Rebecca's idea of being a painter like her friend Miss Ross was gradually receding, owing to the apparently insuperable difficulties in securing any instruction. (8) Her aunt Miranda saw no wisdom in cultivating such a talent, and could not conceive that any money could ever be earned by its exercise, ""Hand painted pictures"" were held in little esteem in Riverboro, where the cheerful chromo or the dignified steel engraving were respected and valued. (9) There was a slight, a very slight hope, that Rebecca might be allowed a few music lessons from Miss Morton, who played the church cabinet organ, but this depended entirely upon whether Mrs. Morton would decide to accept a hayrack in return for a year's instruction from her daughter. (10) She had the matter under advisement, but a doubt as to whether or not she would sell or rent her hayfields kept her from coming to a conclusion. (11) Music, in common with all other accomplishments, was viewed by Miss Miranda as a trivial, useless, and foolish amusement, but she allowed Rebecca an hour a day for practice on the old piano, and a little extra time for lessons, if Jane could secure them without payment of actual cash. (12) The news from Sunnybrook Farm was hopeful rather than otherwise. (13) Cousin Ann's husband had died, and John, Rebecca's favorite brother, had gone to be the man of the house to the widowed cousin. (14) He was to have good schooling in return for his care of the horse and cow and barn, and what was still more dazzling, the use of the old doctor's medical library of two or three dozen volumes. (15) John's whole heart was set on becoming a country doctor, with Rebecca to keep house for him, and the vision seemed now so true, so near, that he could almost imagine his horse ploughing through snowdrifts on errands of mercy, or, less dramatic but none the less attractive, could see a physician's neat turncut trundling along the shady country roads, a medicine case between his, Dr. Randall's, feet, and Miss Rebecca Randall sitting in a black silk dress by his side. (16) Hannah now wore her hair in a coil and her dresses a trifle below her ankles, these concessions being due to her extreme height. (17) Mark had broken his collar bone, but it was healing well. (18) Little Mira was growing very pretty. (19) There was even a rumor that the projected railroad from Temperance to Plumville might go near the Randall farm, in which case land would rise in value from nothing-at-all an acre to something at least resembling a price. (20) Mrs. Randall refused to consider any improvement in their financial condition as a possibility. (21) Content to work from sunrise to sunset to gain a mere subsistence for her children, she lived in their future, not in her own present, as a mother is wont to do when her own lot seems hard and cheerless.

Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) She treated me as a boy still, but she lured me on. (2) We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from France, and that she was going to London. (3) Proud and wilful as of old, she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them from her beauty. (4) Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge, and flit away. (5) In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life. (6) It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. (7) When we had conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel her about a little, as in times of yore. (8) So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. (9) As we drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—



“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”



“You rewarded me very much.”



“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. (10) “I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”



“He and I are great friends now.”



“Are you? (11) I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”



“Yes.”



I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy. (12) “Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,” said Estella. (13) “Naturally,” said I. (14) “And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”



In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put it to flight. (15) “You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting times. (16) “Not the least.”

The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. (17) It would have rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her. (18) The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard. (19) I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I don’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. (20) “No,” said she, and shook her head and looked about her. (21) I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all. (22) “You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything to do with my memory.”



I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that. (23) That I knew better. (24) That there could be no such beauty without it. (25) “Oh! (26) I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said Estella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. (27) But you know what I mean. (28) I have no softness there, no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”



Whatwasit that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me? (29) Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) Jane looked back across the half-forgotten years, and the vision of Tom's gladness flashed upon her: his haggard smile, the tears in his tired eyes, his outstretched arms, his weak voice saying, ""Oh, Jenny! (2) Dear Jenny! (3) I've wanted you so, Jenny!"". (4) It was too much! (5) She had never breathed a word of it before to a human creature, for there was no one who would have understood. (6) Now, in a shamefaced way, to hide her brimming eyes, she put her head down on the young shoulder beside her, saying, ""It was hard, Rebecca!"". (7) The Simpson baby had cuddled down sleepily in Rebecca's lap, leaning her head back and sucking her thumb contentedly. (8) Rebecca put her cheek down until it touched her aunt's gray hair and softly patted her, as she said, ""I'm sorry, aunt Jane!"". (9) The girl's eyes were soft and tender and the heart within her stretched a little and grew; grew in sweetness and intuition and depth of feeling. (10) It had looked into another heart, felt it beat, and heard it sigh; and that is how all hearts grow. (11) Episodes like these enlivened the quiet course of every-day existence, made more quiet by the departure of Dick Carter, Living Perkins, and Huldah Meserve for Wareham, and the small attendance at the winter school, from which the younger children of the place stayed away during the cold weather. (12) Life, however, could never be thoroughly dull or lacking in adventure to a child of Rebecca's temperament. (13) Her nature was full of adaptability, fluidity, receptivity. (14) She made friends everywhere she went, and snatched up acquaintances in every corner. (15) It was she who ran to the shed door to take the dish to the ""meat man"" or ""fish man;"" she who knew the family histories of the itinerant fruit venders and tin peddlers; she who was asked to take supper or pass the night with children in neighboring villages—children of whose parents her aunts had never so much as heard. (16) As to the nature of these friendships, which seemed so many to the eye of the superficial observer, they were of various kinds, and while the girl pursued them with enthusiasm and ardor, they left her unsatisfied and heart-hungry; they were never intimacies such as are so readily made by shallow natures. (17) She loved Emma Jane, but it was a friendship born of propinquity and circumstance, not of true affinity. (18) It was her neighbor's amiability, constancy, and devotion that she loved, and although she rated these qualities at their true value, she was always searching beyond them for intellectual treasures; searching and never finding, for although Emma Jane had the advantage in years she was still immature. (19) Huldah Meserve had an instinctive love of fun which appealed to Rebecca; she also had a fascinating knowledge of the world, from having visited her married sisters in Milltown and Portland; but on the other hand there was a certain sharpness and lack of sympathy in Huldah which repelled rather than attracted. (20) With Dick Carter she could at least talk intelligently about lessons. (21) He was a very ambitious boy, full of plans for his future, which he discussed quite freely with Rebecca, but when she broached the subject of her future his interest sensibly lessened. (22) Into the world of the ideal Emma Jane, Huldah, and Dick alike never seemed to have peeped, and the consciousness of this was always a fixed gulf between them and Rebecca. (23) ""Uncle Jerry"" and ""aunt Sarah"" Cobb were dear friends of quite another sort, a very satisfying and perhaps a somewhat dangerous one. (24) A visit from Rebecca always sent them into a twitter of delight. (25) Her merry conversation and quaint comments on life in general fairly dazzled the old couple, who hung on her lightest word as if it had been a prophet's utterance; and Rebecca, though she had had no previous experience, owned to herself a perilous pleasure in being dazzling, even to a couple of dear humdrum old people like Mr. and Mrs. Cobb. (26) Aunt Sarah flew to the pantry or cellar whenever Rebecca's slim little shape first appeared on the crest of the hill, and a jelly tart or a frosted cake was sure to be forthcoming. (27) The sight of old uncle Jerry's spare figure in its clean white shirt sleeves, whatever the weather, always made Rebecca's heart warm when she saw him peer longingly from the kitchen window. (28) Before the snow came, many was the time he had come out to sit on a pile of boards at the gate, to see if by any chance she was mounting the hill that led to their house. (29) In the autumn Rebecca was often the old man's companion while he was digging potatoes or shelling beans, and now in the winter, when a younger man was driving the stage, she sometimes stayed with him while he did his evening milking. (30) It is safe to say that he was the only creature in Riverboro who possessed Rebecca's entire confidence; the only being to whom she poured out her whole heart, with its wealth of hopes, and dreams, and vague ambitions.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) Nothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for the Sunday School. (2) His church, the Chatham Road Presbyterian, was one of the largest and richest, one of the most oaken and velvety, in Zenith. (3) The pastor was the Reverend John Jennison Drew, M.A., D.D., LL.D. (4) (The M.A. (5) and the D.D. (6) were from Elbert University, Nebraska, the LL.D. (7) from Waterbury College, Oklahoma.) (8) He was eloquent, efficient, and versatile. (9) He presided at meetings for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of domestic service, and confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he had carried newspapers. (10) For the Saturday edition of theEvening Advocatehe wrote editorials on “The Manly Man’s Religion” and “The Dollars and Sense Value of Christianity,” which were printed in bold type surrounded by a wiggly border. (11) He often said that he was “proudto be known as primarily a business man” and that he certainly was not going to “permit the old Satan to monopolize all the pep and punch.” He was a thin, rustic-faced young man with gold spectacles and a bang of dull brown hair, but when he hurled himself into oratory he glowed with power. (12) He admitted that he was too much the scholar and poet to imitate the evangelist, Mike Monday, yet he had once awakened his fold to new life, and to larger collections, by the challenge, “My brethren, the real cheap skate is the man who won’t lend to the Lord!”



He had made his church a true community center. (13) It contained everything but a bar. (14) It had a nursery, a Thursday evening supper with a short bright missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly motion-picture show, a library of technical books for young workmen—though, unfortunately, no young workman ever entered the church except to wash the windows or repair the furnace—and a sewing-circle which made short little pants for the children of the poor while Mrs. Drew read aloud from earnest novels. (15) Though Dr. Drew’s theology was Presbyterian, his church-building was gracefully Episcopalian. (16) As he said, it had the “most perdurable features of those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand Old England which stand as symbols of the eternity of faith, religious and civil.” It was built of cheery iron-spot brick in an improved Gothic style, and the main auditorium had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish alabaster bowls. (17) On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison Drew was unusually eloquent. (18) The crowd was immense. (19) Ten brisk young ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up from the basement. (20) There was an impressive musical program, conducted by Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the offertory. (21) Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile,smile, smile while he was singing, but with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew’s sermon. (22) It had the intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road congregation from the grubby chapels on Smith Street. (23) “At this abundant harvest-time of all the year,” Dr. Drew chanted, “when, though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o’er all the labors and desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those passed happily on; and lo! (24) on the dim horizon we see behind dolorous clouds the mighty mass of mountains—mountains of melody, mountains of mirth, mountains of might!”



“I certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it,” meditated Babbitt. (25) At the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor, actively shaking hands at the door, twittered, “Oh, Brother Babbitt, can you wait a jiffy? (26) Want your advice.”

“Sure, doctor! (27) You bet!”

“Drop into my office. (28) I think you’ll like the cigars there.” Babbitt did like the cigars.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) XVIII. (2) DARK DAYS. (3) did have the fever, and was much sicker than any one but Hannah and the doctor suspected. (4) The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. (5) Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. (6) She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of ""Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle."". (7) Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night; not a hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. (8) But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet, as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left; a time when she did not know the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. (9) Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she ""would think of it, though there was no dangeryet."". (10) A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while. (11) How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! (12) Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy,—in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. (13) Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition, to live for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty. (14) And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. (15) Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. (16) Every one missed Beth. (17) The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to get a shroud for Minna; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made. (18) Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlornprotégé. (19) She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick; and, in her quiet hours, she was full of anxiety about Jo. (20) She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that father might not think she had neglected him. (21) But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. (22) Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side. (23) The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death. (24) When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low tone, to Hannah,—



""If Mrs. Marchcanleave her husband, she'd better be sent for. (25) "".

Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) he second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first. (2) I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me. (3) It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through my arm. (4) “As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. (5) Where are you bound for?”

“For the Temple, I think,” said I. (6) “Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers. (7) “Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination, “I donotknow, for I have not made up my mind.”



“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. (8) “You don’t mind admitting that, I suppose?”

“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”



“And are not engaged?”



“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”



“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”



I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall. (9) At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing, hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the business of the day. (10) As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse, fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients. (11) We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And, as soon as we got there, dinner was served. (12) Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. (13) But it was not to be done. (14) He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one. (15) “Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner. (16) “No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip into the office. (17) Here it is.” He handed it to his principal instead of to me. (18) “It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your address. (19) She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her. (20) You’ll go down?”

“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms. (21) “When do you think of going down?”

“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of my time. (22) At once, I think.”

“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”



Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. (23) Wemmick drank a glass of wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me. (24) “So, Pip! (25) Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his cards. (26) He has won the pool.”

It was as much as I could do to assent.

Book Title: Peter Pan

Book Author: J. M. Barrie

Paragraph: (1) In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke. (2) At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction. (3) “Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. (4) Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. (5) Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. (6) Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. (7) There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven. (8) I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. (9) They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. (10) Again and again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. (11) He had lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray. (12) “Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”



Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. (13) The others drew back and formed a ring around them. (14) For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face. (15) “So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”



“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”



“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”



“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”



Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. (16) Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel home. (17) Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. (18) Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. (19) At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy. (20) “Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword. (21) Hook did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form. (22) Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions assailed him now. (23) “Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily. (24) “I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.”



This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form. (25) “To’t again,” he cried despairingly. (26) He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. (27) And again and again he darted in and pricked. (28) Hook was fighting now without hope. (29) That passionate breast no longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever. (30) Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) Chapters are to be found now in thirty countries. (2) Nine hundred and twenty of the thousand chapters, however, are in the United States. (3) None of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters’ Club. (4) The second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of the year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers. (5) There was agitation abroad. (6) The lunch was held in the ballroom of the O’Hearn House. (7) As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a wallboard a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nickname, and his business. (8) There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of “Hello, Chet!” and “How’re you, Shorty!” and “Top o’ the mornin’, Mac!”



They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot. (9) Babbitt was with Albert Boos the merchant tailor, Hector Seybolt of the Little Sweetheart Condensed Milk Company, Emil Wengert the jeweler, Professor Pumphrey of the Riteway Business College, Dr. Walter Gorbutt, Roy Teegarten the photographer, and Ben Berkey the photo-engraver. (10) One of the merits of the Boosters’ Club was that only two persons from each department of business were permitted to join, so that you at once encountered the Ideals of other occupations, and realized the metaphysical oneness of all occupations—plumbing and portrait-painting, medicine and the manufacture of chewing-gum. (11) Babbitt’s table was particularly happy to-day, because Professor Pumphrey had just had a birthday, and was therefore open to teasing. (12) “Let’s pump Pump about how old he is!” said Emil Wengert. (13) “No, let’s paddle him with a dancing-pump!” said Ben Berkey. (14) But it was Babbitt who had the applause, with “Don’t talk about pumps to that guy! (15) The only pump he knows is a bottle! (16) Honest, they tell me he’s starting a class in home-brewing at the ole college!”



At each place was the Boosters’ Club booklet, listing the members. (17) Though the object of the club was good-fellowship, yet they never lost sight of the importance of doing a little more business. (18) After each name was the member’s occupation. (19) There were scores of advertisements in the booklet, and on one page the admonition: “There’s no rule that you have to trade with your Fellow Boosters, but get wise, boy—what’s the use of letting all this good money get outside of our happy fambly?” And at each place, to-day, there was a present; a card printed in artistic red and black:



SERVICE AND BOOSTERISM



Service finds its finest opportunity and development only in its broadest and deepest application and the consideration of its perpetual action upon reaction. (20) I believe the highest type of Service, like the most progressive tenets of ethics, senses unceasingly and is motived by active adherence and loyalty to that which is the essential principle of Boosterism—Good Citizenship in all its factors and aspects. (21) Compliments of Dadbury Petersen Advertising Corp.“Ads, not Fads, at Dad’s”



The Boosters all read Mr. Peterson’s aphorism and said they understood it perfectly. (22) The meeting opened with the regular weekly “stunts.” Retiring President Vergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his voice like a brazen gong of festival. (23) Members who had brought guests introduced them publicly. (24) “This tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting editor of thePress,” said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the druggist, chanted, “Boys, when you’re on a long motor tour and finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, ‘This is certainly a romantic place,’ it sends a glow right up and down your vertebræ. (25) Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good Booster, goes marching on—”



There were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the “Bird of Paradise” company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater, and the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. (26) Lucas Prout. (27) Vergil Gunch thundered, “When we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses—and I got to admit I butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters appreciated the high-class artistic performance he’s giving us—and don’t forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will appreciate our patronage—and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor out of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we’ve done ourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties—”



By rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations, donated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the Jennifer Avenue florist. (28) Each week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to four fellow-members, chosen by lot. (29) Therewas laughter, this week, when it was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the undertaker.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) XLII. (2) ALL ALONE. (3) was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. (4) How could she ""comfort father and mother,"" when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister; how could she ""make the house cheerful,"" when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new; and where in all the world could she ""find some useful, happy work to do,"" that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward? (5) She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. (6) Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble, and hard work. (7) Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. (8) ""I can't do it. (9) I wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody don't come and help me,"" she said to herself, when her first efforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable. (10) But some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. (11) Often she started up at night, thinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, ""O Beth, come back! (12) come back!"". (13) she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. (14) Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and strengthened love. (15) Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms. (16) When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very humbly,—



""Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. (17) I need it more than she did, for I'm all wrong."". (18) ""My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,"" he answered, with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and did not fear to ask it. (19) Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her troubles,—the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. (20) She gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation in the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. (21) Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called ""the church of one member,"" and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power. (22) Other helps had Jo,—humble, wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to see and value. (23) Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old brush, that was never thrown away.

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) XXX. (2) CONSEQUENCES. (3) fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and every one was much interested in the matter. (4) Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. (5) The ""haughty, uninteresting creature"" was let severely alone; but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art-table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it. (6) Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened; then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five and twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together. (7) May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and, just at this time, several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. (8) Amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases,—that was one thorn; then the all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy, at a late party, and only once with May,—that was thorn number two; but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. (9) All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. (10) No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,—



""I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to any one but my girls. (11) As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. (12) I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like."". (13) Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech; but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her, full of surprise and trouble. (14) Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,—



""Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"". (15) ""Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg; it's merely a matter of expediency, you see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place.Ithink it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty; but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. (16) Wouldn't you like the flower-table? (17) The little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. (18) You could make a charming thing of it, and the flower-table is always attractive, you know."". (19) ""Especially to gentlemen,"" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. (20) She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered, with unexpected amiability,—



""It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. (21) I'll give up my place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."". (22) ""You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,"" began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. (23) She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly,—



""Oh, certainly, if they are in your way;"" and sweeping her contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) Often of a morning Babbitt came bouncing and jesting in to breakfast. (2) But things were mysteriously awry to-day. (3) As he pontifically tread the upper hall he looked into Verona’s bedroom and protested, “What’s the use of giving the family a high-class house when they don’t appreciate it and tend to business and get down to brass tacks?”



He marched upon them: Verona, a dumpy brown-haired girl of twenty-two, just out of Bryn Mawr, given to solicitudes about duty and sex and God and the unconquerable bagginess of the gray sports-suit she was now wearing. (4) Ted—Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt—a decorative boy of seventeen. (5) Tinka—Katherine—still a baby at ten, with radiant red hair and a thin skin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas. (6) Babbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in. (7) He really disliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it was frequent. (8) He shouted at Tinka, “Well, kittiedoolie!” It was the only pet name in his vocabulary, except the “dear” and “hon.” with which he recognized his wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning. (9) He gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his soul. (10) His stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him, but Verona began to be conscientious and annoying, and abruptly there returned to Babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business which had clawed at him when his dream-life and the slim fairy girl had fled. (11) Verona had for six months been filing-clerk at the Gruensberg Leather Company offices, with a prospect of becoming secretary to Mr. Gruensberg and thus, as Babbitt defined it, “getting some good out of your expensive college education till you’re ready to marry and settle down.”



But now said Verona: “Father! (12) I was talking to a classmate of mine that’s working for the Associated Charities—oh, Dad, there’s the sweetest little babies that come to the milk-station there! (13) and I feel as though I ought to be doing something worth while like that.”



“What do you mean ‘worth while’? (14) If you get to be Gruensberg’s secretary—and maybe you would, if you kept up your shorthand and didn’t go sneaking off to concerts and talk-fests every evening—I guess you’ll find thirty-five or forty bones a week worth while!”



“I know, but—oh, I want to—contribute— I wish I were working in a settlement-house. (15) I wonder if I could get one of the department-stores to let me put in a welfare-department with a nice rest-room and chintzes and wicker chairs and so on and so forth. (16) Or I could—”

“Now you look here! (17) The first thing you got to understand is that all this uplift and flipflop and settlement-work and recreation is nothing in God’s world but the entering wedge for socialism. (18) The sooner a man learns he isn’t going to be coddled, and he needn’t expect a lot of free grub and, uh, all these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his kids unless he earns ’em, why, the sooner he’ll get on the job and produce—produce—produce! (19) That’s what the country needs, and not all this fancy stuff that just enfeebles the will-power of the working man and gives his kids a lot of notions above their class. (20) And you—if you’d tend to business instead of fooling and fussing— All the time! (21) When I was a young man I made up my mind what I wanted to do, and stuck to it through thick and thin, and that’s why I’m where I am to-day, and— Myra! (22) What do you let the girl chop the toast up into these dinky little chunks for? (23) Can’t get your fist onto ’em. (24) Half cold, anyway!”

Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making hiccup-like sounds of interruption. (25) He blurted now, “Say, Rone, you going to—”

Verona whirled. (26) “Ted! (27) Will you kindly not interrupt us when we’re talking about serious matters!”



“Aw punk,” said Ted judicially.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) Rebecca, Adam thought, as he took off his hat and saluted the pretty panorama,—Rebecca, with her tall slenderness, her thoughtful brow, the fire of young joy in her face, her fillet of dark braided hair, might have been a young Muse or Sibyl; and the flowery hayrack, with its freight of blooming girlhood, might have been painted as an allegorical picture of The Morning of Life. (2) It all passed him, as he stood under the elms in the old village street where his mother had walked half a century ago, and he was turning with the crowd towards the church when he heard a little sob. (3) Behind a hedge in the garden near where he was standing was a forlorn person in white, whose neat nose, chestnut hair, and blue eyes he seemed to know. (4) He stepped inside the gate and said, ""What's wrong, Miss Emma?"". (5) ""Oh, is it you, Mr. Ladd? (6) Rebecca wouldn't let me cry for fear of spoiling my looks, but I must have just one chance before I go in. (7) I can be as homely as I like, after all, for I only have to sing with the school; I'm not graduating, I'm just leaving! (8) Not that I mind that; it's only being separated from Rebecca that I never can stand!"". (9) The two walked along together, Adam comforting the disconsolate Emma Jane, until they reached the old meeting-house where the Commencement exercises were always held. (10) The interior, with its decorations of yellow, green, and white, was crowded, the air hot and breathless, the essays and songs and recitations precisely like all others that have been since the world began. (11) One always fears that the platform may sink under the weight of youthful platitudes uttered on such occasions; yet one can never be properly critical, because the sight of the boys and girls themselves, those young and hopeful makers of to-morrow, disarms one's scorn. (12) We yawn desperately at the essays, but our hearts go out to the essayists, all the same, for ""the vision splendid"" is shining in their eyes, and there is no fear of ""th' inevitable yoke"" that the years are so surely bringing them. (13) Rebecca saw Hannah and her husband in the audience; dear old John and cousin Ann also, and felt a pang at the absence of her mother, though she had known there was no possibility of seeing her; for poor Aurelia was kept at Sunnybrook by cares of children and farm, and lack of money either for the journey or for suitable dress. (14) The Cobbs she saw too. (15) No one, indeed, could fail to see uncle Jerry; for he shed tears more than once, and in the intervals between the essays descanted to his neighbors concerning the marvelous gifts of one of the graduating class whom he had known ever since she was a child; in fact, had driven her from Maplewood to Riverboro when she left her home, and he had told mother that same night that there wan't nary rung on the ladder o' fame that that child wouldn't mount before she got through with it. (16) The Cobbs, then, had come, and there were other Riverboro faces, but where was aunt Jane, in her black silk made over especially for this occasion? (17) Aunt Miranda had not intended to come, she knew, but where, on this day of days, was her beloved aunt Jane? (18) However, this thought, like all others, came and went in a flash, for the whole morning was like a series of magic lantern pictures, crossing and recrossing her field of vision. (19) She played, she sang, she recited Queen Mary's Latin prayer, like one in a dream, only brought to consciousness by meeting Mr. Aladdin's eyes as she spoke the last line. (20) Then at the end of the programme came her class poem, Makers of To-morrow; and there, as on many a former occasion, her personality played so great a part that she seemed to be uttering Miltonic sentiments instead of school-girl verse. (21) Her voice, her eyes, her body breathed conviction, earnestness, emotion; and when she left the platform the audience felt that they had listened to a masterpiece. (22) Most of her hearers knew little of Carlyle or Emerson, or they might have remembered that the one said, ""We are all poets when we read a poem well,"" and the other, ""'T is the good reader makes the good book."". (23) It was over! (24) The diplomas had been presented, and each girl, after giving furtive touches to her hair, sly tweaks to her muslin skirts, and caressing pats to her sash, had gone forward to receive the roll of parchment with a bow that had been the subject of anxious thought for weeks. (25) Rounds of applause greeted each graduate at this thrilling moment, and Jeremiah Cobb's behavior, when Rebecca came forward, was the talk of Wareham and Riverboro for days. (26) Old Mrs. Webb avowed that he, in the space of two hours, had worn out her pew more—the carpet, the cushions, and woodwork—than she had by sitting in it forty years. (27) Yes, it was over, and after the crowd had thinned a little, Adam Ladd made his way to the platform. (28) Rebecca turned from speaking to some strangers and met him in the aisle. (29) ""Oh, Mr. Aladdin, I am so glad you could come! (30) Tell me""—and she looked at him half shyly, for his approval was dearer to her, and more difficult to win, than that of the others—""tell me, Mr. Aladdin,—were you satisfied? (31) "".

Book Title: Persuasion

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of.”



Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence? (2) She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate’s being married. (3) “I wish,” said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, “I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley. (4) I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody! (5) I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything! (6) I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.”



Anne was amused by Henrietta’s manner of being grateful, and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta’s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them. (7) They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready; but Louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town. (8) They were all at her disposal. (9) When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back, and stopped to give them way. (10) They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne’s face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of. (11) She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced. (12) It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly. (13) Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it. (14) He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, “That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.”



After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment. (15) She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant. (16) Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea. (17) It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman’s looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners. (18) He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an agreeable person. (19) Anne felt that she should like to know who he was. (20) They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to the window. (21) It was a gentleman’s carriage, a curricle, but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going away. (22) It was driven by a servant in mourning. (23) The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne’s curiosity, and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off. (24) “Ah!” cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne, “it is the very man we passed.”



The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table. (25) The waiter came into the room soon afterwards. (26) “Pray,” said Captain Wentworth, immediately, “can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away?”



“Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night from Sidmouth. (27) Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London.”



“Elliot!” Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity of a waiter. (28) “Bless me!” cried Mary; “it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot, it must, indeed! (29) Charles, Anne, must not it? (30) In mourning, you see, just as our Mr Elliot must be.

Book Title: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm

Book Author: Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin

Paragraph: (1) They had been called the Sawyer girls when Miranda at eighteen, Jane at twelve, and Aurelia at eight participated in the various activities of village life; and when Riverboro fell into a habit of thought or speech, it saw no reason for falling out of it, at any rate in the same century. (2) So although Miranda and Jane were between fifty and sixty at the time this story opens, Riverboro still called them the Sawyer girls. (3) They were spinsters; but Aurelia, the youngest, had made what she called a romantic marriage and what her sisters termed a mighty poor speculation. (4) ""There's worse things than bein' old maids,"" they said; whether they thought so is quite another matter. (5) The element of romance in Aurelia's marriage existed chiefly in the fact that Mr. L. D. M. Randall had a soul above farming or trading and was a votary of the Muses. (6) He taught the weekly singing-school (then a feature of village life) in half a dozen neighboring towns, he played the violin and ""called off"" at dances, or evoked rich harmonies from church melodeons on Sundays. (7) He taught certain uncouth lads, when they were of an age to enter society, the intricacies of contra dances, or the steps of the schottische and mazurka, and he was a marked figure in all social assemblies, though conspicuously absent from town-meetings and the purely masculine gatherings at the store or tavern or bridge. (8) His hair was a little longer, his hands a little whiter, his shoes a little thinner, his manner a trifle more polished, than that of his soberer mates; indeed the only department of life in which he failed to shine was the making of sufficient money to live upon. (9) Luckily he had no responsibilities; his father and his twin brother had died when he was yet a boy, and his mother, whose only noteworthy achievement had been the naming of her twin sons Marquis de Lafayette and Lorenzo de Medici Randall, had supported herself and educated her child by making coats up to the very day of her death. (10) She was wont to say plaintively, ""I'm afraid the faculties was too much divided up between my twins. (11) L. D. M. is awful talented, but I guess M. D. L. would 'a' ben the practical one if he'd 'a' lived."". (12) ""L. D. M. was practical enough to get the richest girl in the village,"" replied Mrs. Robinson. (13) ""Yes,"" sighed his mother, ""there it is again; if the twins could 'a' married Aurelia Sawyer, 't would 'a' been all right. (14) L. D. M. was talented 'nough to GET Reely's money, but M. D. L. would 'a' ben practical 'nough to have KEP' it."". (15) Aurelia's share of the modest Sawyer property had been put into one thing after another by the handsome and luckless Lorenzo de Medici. (16) He had a graceful and poetic way of making an investment for each new son and daughter that blessed their union. (17) ""A birthday present for our child, Aurelia,"" he would say,—""a little nest-egg for the future;"" but Aurelia once remarked in a moment of bitterness that the hen never lived that could sit on those eggs and hatch anything out of them. (18) Miranda and Jane had virtually washed their hands of Aurelia when she married Lorenzo de Medici Randall. (19) Having exhausted the resources of Riverboro and its immediate vicinity, the unfortunate couple had moved on and on in a steadily decreasing scale of prosperity until they had reached Temperance, where they had settled down and invited fate to do its worst, an invitation which was promptly accepted. (20) The maiden sisters at home wrote to Aurelia two or three times a year, and sent modest but serviceable presents to the children at Christmas, but refused to assist L. D. M. with the regular expenses of his rapidly growing family. (21) His last investment, made shortly before the birth of Miranda (named in a lively hope of favors which never came), was a small farm two miles from Temperance.

Book Title: Babbitt

Book Author: Sinclair Lewis

Paragraph: (1) “That’s the way I look at it. (2) If a fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you get it here in Zenith—all the hustle and mental activity that’s going on with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the Z.A.C., why, he’s got to save his nerves by having the best.”



Babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and by the conclusion, in Gunch’s renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:



“Still, at that, George, don’t know’s you can afford it. (3) I’ve heard your business has been kind of under the eye of the gov’ment since you stole the tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!”



“Oh, you’re a great little josher, Verg. (4) But when it comes to kidding, how about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the post-office and sold ’em for high-gradecoal!” In delight Babbitt patted Gunch’s back, stroked his arm. (5) “That’s all right, but what I want to know is: who’s the real-estate shark that bought that coal for his apartment-houses?”



“I guess that’ll hold you for a while, George!” said Finkelstein. (6) “I’ll tell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George’s missus went into the gents’ wear department at Parcher’s to buy him some collars, and before she could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. (7) ‘How juh know the size?’ says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, ‘Men that let their wives buy collars for ’em always wear thirteen, madam.’ How’s that! (8) That’s pretty good, eh? (9) How’s that, eh? (10) I guess that’ll about fix you, George!”

“I—I—” Babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. (11) He stopped, stared at the door. (12) Paul Riesling was coming in. (13) Babbitt cried, “See you later, boys,” and hastened across the lobby. (14) He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. (15) He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. (16) Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days—and they said:



“How’s the old horse-thief?”



“All right, I guess. (17) How’re you, you poor shrimp?”

“I’m first-rate, you second-hand hunk o’ cheese.”



Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, “You’re a fine guy, you are! (18) Ten minutes late!” Riesling snapped, “Well, you’re lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!” They grinned and went into the Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration beforetheir own images in the massy mirror. (19) Voices thick, satisfied, authoritative, hurtled along the marble walls, bounded from the ceiling of lavender-bordered milky tiles, while the lords of the city, the barons of insurance and law and fertilizers and motor tires, laid down the law for Zenith; announced that the day was warm—indeed, indisputably of spring; that wages were too high and the interest on mortgages too low; that Babe Ruth, the eminent player of baseball, was a noble man; and that “those two nuts at the Climax Vaudeville Theater this week certainly are a slick pair of actors.” Babbitt, though ordinarily his voice was the surest and most episcopal of all, was silent. (20) In the presence of the slight dark reticence of Paul Riesling, he was awkward, he desired to be quiet and firm and deft. (21) The entrance lobby of the Athletic Club was Gothic, the washroom Roman Imperial, the lounge Spanish Mission, and the reading-room in Chinese Chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the masterpiece of Ferdinand Reitman, Zenith’s busiest architect. (22) It was lofty and half-timbered, with Tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a somewhat musicianless musicians’-gallery, and tapestries believed to illustrate the granting of Magna Charta. (23) The open beams had been hand-adzed at Jake Offutt’s car-body works, the hinges were of hand-wrought iron, the wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs, and at one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which the club’s advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any of the fireplaces in European castles but of a draught incomparably more scientific. (24) It was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in it. (25) Half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men. (26) Babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including Gunch, Finkelstein, Professor Pumphrey, Howard Littlefield, his neighbor, T. Cholmondeley Frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and Orville Jones, whoselaundry was in many ways the best in Zenith. (27) They composed a club within the club, and merrily called themselves “The Roughnecks.” To-day as he passed their table the Roughnecks greeted him, “Come on, sit in! (28) You ’n’ Paul too proud to feed with poor folks? (29) Afraid somebody might stick you for a bottle of Bevo, George? (30) Strikes me you swells are getting awful darn exclusive!”



He thundered, “You bet!

Book Title: Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have amused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe the new-comer with brotherly circumspection. (2) But it did not last long. (3) He got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn into the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. (4) He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. (5) Then his eye would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt. (6) A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. (7) Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. (8) Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic. (9) Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, ""How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!"". (10) Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. (11) His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. (12) Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands! (13) ""Dear old fellow! (14) He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd been going a-wooing,"" said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought, born of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face. (15) The manœuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for, though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball. (16) Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them. (17) Nobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. (18) The others sat round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go. (19) ""We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together again once more,"" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul. (20) They were notallthere. (21) But no one found the words thoughtless or untrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence, invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the household league that love made indissoluble. (22) The little chair stood in its old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew ""so heavy,"" was still on its accustomed shelf; the beloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, ""Be happy. (23) I am here."". (24) ""Play something, Amy. (25) Let them hear how much you have improved,"" said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil. (26) But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,—



""Not to-night, dear. (27) I can't show off to-night."". (28) But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. (29) The room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn. (30) It was hard to say,—

""Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;""



and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.

Book Title: Great Expectations

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) I was always in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a getting into danger. (2) He was younger than me, but he’d got craft, and he’d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy. (3) My Missis as I had the hard time wi’—Stop though! (4) I ain’t broughtherin—”

He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them on again. (5) “There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once more. (6) “The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I had; that said, all’s said. (7) Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”



I answered, No. (8) “Well!” he said, “Iwas, and got convicted. (9) As to took up on suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting. (10) At last, me and Compeyson was both committed for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,—and there was other charges behind. (11) Compeyson says to me, ‘Separate defences, no communication,’ and that was all. (12) And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers. (13) “When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. (14) When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. (15) When the evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had come for’ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit. (16) But when the defence come on, then I see the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, ‘My lord and gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in ’em and always wi’ his guilt brought home. (17) Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?’ And such-like. (18) And when it come to character, warn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him as had been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? (19) And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as had been know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! (20) And when it come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’ his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket-handkercher,—ah! (21) and wi’ verses in his speech, too,—and warn’t it me as could only say, ‘Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most precious rascal’? (22) And when the verdict come, warn’t it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me, and warn’t it me as got never a word but Guilty? (23) And when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out of this court, I’ll smash that face of yourn!’ ain’t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? (24) And when we’re sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain’t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”



He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain’t a-going to be low, dear boy!”



He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on. (25) “I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I swore Lord smash mine! (26) to do it. (27) We was in the same prison-ship, but I couldn’t get at him for long, though I tried. (28) At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him, when I was seen and seized. (29) The black-hole of that ship warn’t a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. (30) I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”



He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.

Book Title: Crime and Punishment

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch. (2) Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it. (3) “So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking. (4) “I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,” Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. (5) If I spoke so rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and... mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this morning I am ashamed of it.”



He crimsoned and ceased speaking. (6) Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence. (7) She had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin. (8) Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do. (9) At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance. (10) “You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. (11) “I’ll be perfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”



“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically. (12) “This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. (13) “Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. (14) He promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning. (15) But this morning this note came from him. (16) You’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! (17) You know Rodya’s character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. (18) Dounia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act and I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”



Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows:



“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object in view. (19) I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. (20) I shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview—as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own interpretation. (21) I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame. (22) I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able to leave the house, may visit you also. (23) I was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum. (24) Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of



“Your humble servant,



“P. (25) LUZHIN.”

“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna, almost weeping. (26) “How can I ask Rodya not to come? (27) Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive Rodya! (28) He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will happen then?”



“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at once. (29) “Oh, dear me! (30) She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t explain her object!
