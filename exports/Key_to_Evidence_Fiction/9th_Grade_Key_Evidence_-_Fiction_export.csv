Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) “Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil.”—ST. (2) MATTHEWv. (3) 38, 39. (4) It was in the time of serfdom—many years before Alexander II.’s liberation of the sixty million serfs in 1862. (5) In those days the people were ruled by different kinds of lords. (6) There were not a few who, remembering God, treated their slaves in a humane manner, and not as beasts of burden, while there were others who were seldom known to perform a kind or generous action; but the most barbarous and tyrannical of all were those former serfs who arose from the dirt and became princes. (7) It was this latter class who made life literally a burden to those who were unfortunate enough to come under their rule. (8) Many of them had arisen from the ranks of the peasantry to become superintendents of noblemen’s estates. (9) The peasants were obliged to work for their master a certain number of days each week. (10) There was plenty of land and water and the soil was rich and fertile, while the meadows and forests were sufficient to supply the needs of both the peasants and their lord. (11) There was a certain nobleman who had chosen a superintendent from the peasantry on one of his other estates. (12) No sooner had the power to govern been vested in this newly-made official than he began to practice the most outrageous cruelties upon the poor serfs who had been placed under his control. (13) Although this man had a wife and two married daughters, and was making so much money that he could have lived happily without transgressing in any way against either God or man, yet he was filled with envy and jealousy and deeply sunk in sin. (14) Michael Simeonovitch began his persecutions by compelling the peasants to perform more days of service on the estate every week than the laws obliged them to work. (15) He established a brick-yard, in which he forced the men and women to do excessive labor, selling the bricks for his own profit. (16) On one occasion the overworked serfs sent a delegation to Moscow to complain of their treatment to their lord, but they obtained no satisfaction. (17) When the poor peasants returned disconsolate from the nobleman their superintendent determined to have revenge for their boldness in going above him for redress, and their life and that of their fellow-victims became worse than before. (18) It happened that among the serfs there were some very treacherous people who would falsely accuse their fellows of wrong-doing and sow seeds of discord among the peasantry, whereupon Michael would become greatly enraged, while his poor subjects began to live in fear of their lives. (19) When the superintendent passed through the village the people would run and hide themselves as from a wild beast. (20) Seeing thus the terror which he had struck to the hearts of the moujiks, Michael’s treatment of them became still more vindictive, so that from over-work and ill-usage the lot of the poor serfs was indeed a hard one. (21) There was a time when it was possible for the peasants, when driven to despair, to devise means whereby they could rid themselves of an inhuman monster such as Simeonovitch, and so these unfortunate people began to consider whether something could not be done to relievethemof their intolerable yoke. (22) They would hold little meetings in secret places to bewail their misery and to confer with one another as to which would be the best way to act. (23) Now and then the boldest of the gathering would rise and address his companions in this strain: “How much longer can we tolerate such a villain to rule over us? (24) Let us make an end of it at once, for it were better for us to perish than to suffer. (25) It is surely not a sin to kill such a devil in human form.”



It happened once, before the Easter holidays, that one of these meetings was held in the woods, where Michael had sent the serfs to make a clearance for their master. (26) At noon they assembled to eat their dinner and to hold a consultation. (27) “Why can’t we leave now?” said one. (28) “Very soon we shall be reduced to nothing. (29) Already we are almost worked to death—there being no rest, night or day, either for us or our poor women.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) It is not, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. (2) If the person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty certain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch a second glance. (3) Or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our microscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations, magnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and of course patch him very clumsily together again. (4) What wonder, then, should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after all,—though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real personage,—may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves. (5) Thus, as my conscience has often whispered me, I did Hollingsworth a great wrong by prying into his character; and am perhaps doing him as great a one, at this moment, by putting faith in the discoveries which I seemed to make. (6) But I could not help it. (7) Had I loved him less, I might have used him better. (8) He and Zenobia and Priscilla—both for their own sakes and as connected with him—were separated from the rest of the Community, to my imagination, and stood forth as the indices of a problem which it was my business to solve. (9) Other associates had a portion of my time; other matters amused me; passing occurrences carried me along with them, while they lasted. (10) But here was the vortex of my meditations, around which they revolved, and whitherward they too continually tended. (11) In the midst of cheerful society, I had often a feeling of loneliness. (12) For it was impossible not to be sensible that, while these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre, I—though probably reckoned as a friend by all—was at best but a secondary or tertiary personage with either of them. (13) I loved Hollingsworth, as has already been enough expressed. (14) But it impressed me, more and more, that there was a stern and dreadful peculiarity in this man, such as could not prove otherwise than pernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too intimate a connection with him. (15) He was not altogether human. (16) There was something else in Hollingsworth besides flesh and blood, and sympathies and affections and celestial spirit. (17) This is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an overruling purpose. (18) It does not so much impel them from without, nor even operate as a motive power within, but grows incorporate with all that they think and feel, and finally converts them into little else save that one principle. (19) When such begins to be the predicament, it is not cowardice, but wisdom, to avoid these victims. (20) They have no heart, no sympathy, no reason, no conscience. (21) They will keep no friend, unless he make himself the mirror of their purpose; they will smite and slay you, and trample your dead corpse under foot, all the more readily, if you take the first step with them, and cannot take the second, and the third, and every other step of their terribly strait path. (22) They have an idol to which they consecrate themselves high-priest, and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is most precious; and never once seem to suspect—so cunning has the Devil been with them—that this false deity, in whose iron features, immitigable to all the rest of mankind, they see only benignity and love, is but a spectrum of the very priest himself, projected upon the surrounding darkness. (23) And the higher and purer the original object, and the more unselfishly it may have been taken up, the slighter is the probability that they can be led to recognize the process by which godlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism. (24) Of course I am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated, in the attempt to make it adequate. (25) Professed philanthropists have gone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far as this. (26) Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit.

Book Title: Anne of Green Gables

Book Author: L.M. Montgomery

Paragraph: (1) It can’t bring him back. (2) It—it—isn’t right to cry so. (3) I knew that today, but I couldn’t help it then. (4) He’d always been such a good, kind brother to me—but God knows best.”



“Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,” sobbed Anne. (5) “The tears don’t hurt me like that ache did. (6) Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me—so. (7) I couldn’t have Diana stay, she’s good and kind and sweet—but it’s not her sorrow—she’s outside of it and she couldn’t come close enough to my heart to help me. (8) It’s our sorrow—yours and mine. (9) Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?”

“We’ve got each other, Anne. (10) I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t here—if you’d never come. (11) Oh, Anne, I know I’ve been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe—but you mustn’t think I didn’t love you as well as Matthew did, for all that. (12) I want to tell you now when I can. (13) It’s never been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this it’s easier. (14) I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you’ve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.”



Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before, although always with the aching sense of “loss in all familiar things.” Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so—that theycouldgo on in the old way without Matthew. (15) She felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them—that Diana’s visits were pleasant to her and that Diana’s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles—that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices. (16) “It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in these things now that he has gone,” she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan one evening when they were together in the manse garden. (17) “I miss him so much—all the time—and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all. (18) Today Diana said something funny and I found myself laughing. (19) I thought when it happened I could never laugh again. (20) And it somehow seems as if I oughtn’t to.”

“When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,” said Mrs. Allan gently. (21) “He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the same. (22) I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us. (23) But I can understand your feeling. (24) I think we all experience the same thing. (25) We resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us, and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us.”



“I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew’s grave this afternoon,” said Anne dreamily. (26) “I took a slip of the little white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew always liked those roses the best—they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems. (27) It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave—as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him. (28) I hope he has roses like them in heaven. (29) Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him. (30) I must go home now.

Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) I have received, and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from persons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain and simple language my own views on the subject handled in the story entitled “The Kreutzer Sonata.” With this request I shall now endeavor to comply. (2) My views on the question may be succinctly stated as follows: Without entering into details, it will be generally admitted that I am accurate in saying that many people condone in young men a course of conduct with regard to the other sex which is incompatible with strict morality, and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. (3) Both parents and the government, in consequence of this view, may be said to wink at profligacy, and even in the last resource to encourage its practice. (4) I am of opinion that this is not right. (5) It is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the ruin of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a deaf ear to such an essential immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly society may have established or law protected it. (6) Moreover, it needs to be fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for the consequences of their own acts, and that these are no longer to be visited on the woman alone. (7) It follows from this that it is the duty of men who do not wish to lead a life of infamy to practice such continence in respect to all woman as they would were the female society in which they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and sisters. (8) A more rational mode of life should be adopted which would include abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from excess in eating and from flesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the other. (9) I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations which may be fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine toil that fatigues. (10) No one need go far in search of proofs that this kind of abstemious living is not merely possible, but far less hurtful to health than excess. (11) Hundreds of instances are known to every one. (12) This is my first contention. (13) In the second place, I think that of late years, through various reasons which I need not enter, but among which the above-mentioned laxity of opinion in society and the frequent idealization of the subject in current literature and painting may be mentioned, conjugal infidelity has become more common and is considered less reprehensible. (14) I am of opinion that this is not right. (15) The origin of the evil is twofold. (16) It is due, in the first place, to a natural instinct, and, in the second, to the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it does not rightly belong. (17) This being so, the evil can only be remedied by effecting a change in the views now in vogue about “falling in love” and all that this term implies, by educating men and women at home through family influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy public opinion, to practice that abstinence which morality and Christianity alike enjoin. (18) This is my second contention. (19) In the third place I am of opinion that another consequence of the false light in which “falling in love,” and what it leads to, are viewed in our society, is that the birth of children has lost its pristine significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and less from the point of view of the family. (20) I am of opinion that this is not right. (21) This is my third contention. (22) In the fourth place, I am of opinion that the children (who in our society are considered an obstacle to enjoyment—an unlucky accident, as it were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be one day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to the pleasure which they may be made to yield to their parents. (23) The consequence is, that the children of human beings are brought up for all the world like the young of animals, the chief care of their parents being not to train them to such work as is worthy of men and women, but to increase their weight, or add a cubit to their stature, to make them spruce, sleek, well-fed, and comely. (24) They rig them out in all manner of fantastic costumes, wash them, over-feed them, and refuse to make them work. (25) If the children of the lower orders differ in this last respect from those of the well-to-do classes, the difference is merely formal; they work from sheer necessity, and not because their parents recognize work as a duty. (26) And in over-fed children, as in over-fed animals, sensuality is engendered unnaturally early.

Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) The old devil, having finished with the second brother, went to Ivan the Fool. (2) This time he disguised himself as a General, the same as in the case of Simeon, and, appearing before Ivan, said: “Get an army together. (3) It is disgraceful for the ruler of a kingdom to be without an army. (4) You call your people to assemble, and I will form them into a fine large army.”



Ivan took the supposed General’s advice, and said: “Well, you may form my people into an army, but you must also teach them to sing the songs I like.”



The old devil then went through Ivan’s kingdom to secure recruits for the army, saying: “Come, shave your heads [the heads of recruits are always shaved in Russia] and I will give each of you a red hat and plenty of vodka” (whiskey). (5) At this the fools only laughed, and said: “We can have all the vodka we want, for we distill it ourselves; and of hats, our little girls make all we want, of any color we please, and with handsome fringes.”



Thus was the devil foiled in securing recruits for his army; so he returned to Ivan and said: “Your fools will not volunteer to be soldiers. (6) It will therefore be necessary to force them.”

“Very well,” replied Ivan, “you may use force if you want to.”



The old devil then announced that all the fools must become soldiers, and those who refused, Ivan would punish with death. (7) The fools went to the General; and said: “You tell us that Ivan will punish with death all those who refuse to become soldiers, but you have omitted to state what will be done with us soldiers. (8) We have been told that we are only to be killed.”



“Yes, that is true,” was the reply. (9) The fools on hearing this became stubborn and refused to go. (10) “Better kill us now if we cannot avoid death, but we will not become soldiers,” they declared. (11) “Oh! (12) you fools,” said the old devil, “soldiers may and may not be killed; but if you disobey Ivan’s orders you will find certain death at his hands.”



The fools remained absorbed in thought for some time and finally went to Ivan to question him in regard to the matter. (13) On arriving at his house they said: “A General came to us with an order from you that we were all to become soldiers, and if we refused you were to punish us with death. (14) Is it true?”

Ivan began to laugh heartily on hearing this, and said: “Well, how I alone can punish you with death is something I cannot understand. (15) If I was not a fool myself I would be able to explain it to you, but as it is I cannot.”



“Well, then, we will not go,” they said. (16) “Very well,” replied Ivan, “you need not become soldiers unless you wish to.”



The old devil, seeing his schemes about to prove failures, went to the ruler of Tarakania and became his friend, saying: “Let us go and conquer Ivan’s kingdom. (17) He has no money, but he has plenty of cattle, provisions, and various other things that would be useful to us.”



The Tarakanian ruler gathered his large army together, and equipping it with cannons and rifles, crossed the boundary line into Ivan’s kingdom. (18) The people went to Ivan and said: “The ruler of Tarakania is here with a large army to fight us.”



“Let them come,” replied Ivan. (19) The Tarakanian ruler, after crossing the line into Ivan’s kingdom, looked in vain for soldiers to fight against; and waiting some time and none appearing, he sent his own warriors to attack the villages. (20) They soon reached the first village, which they began to plunder. (21) The fools of both sexes looked calmly on, offering not the least resistance when their cattle and provisions were being taken from them. (22) On the contrary, they invited the soldiers to come and live with them, saying: “If you, dear friends, find it is difficult to earn a living in your own land, come and live with us, where everything is plentiful.”



The soldiers decided to remain, finding the people happy and prosperous, with enough surplus food to supply many of their neighbors. (23) They were surprised at the cordial greetings which they everywhere received, and, returning to the ruler of Tarakania, they said: “We cannot fight with these people—take us to another place. (24) We would much prefer the dangers of actual warfare to this unsoldierly method of subduing the village.”



The Tarakanian ruler, becoming enraged, ordered the soldiers to destroy the whole kingdom, plunder the villages, burn the houses and provisions, and slaughter the cattle. (25) “Should you disobey my orders,” said he, “I will have every one of you executed.”



The soldiers, becoming frightened, started to do as they were ordered, but the fools wept bitterly, offering no resistance, men, women, and children all joining in the general lamentation.

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) Like children are all people.”



At about noon, he came through a village. (2) In front of the mud cottages, children were rolling about in the street, were playing with pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all timidly fled from the unknown Samana. (3) In the end of the village, the path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young woman was kneeling and washing clothes. (4) When Siddhartha greeted her, she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw the white in her eyes glistening. (5) He called out a blessing to her, as it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go to reach the large city. (6) Then she got up and came to him, beautifully her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face. (7) She exchanged humorous banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not allowed to have any women with them. (8) While talking, she put her left foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks call “climbing a tree”. (9) Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her breast. (10) Looking up, he saw her face smiling full of lust and her eyes, with contracted pupils, begging with desire. (11) Siddhartha also felt desire and felt the source of his sexuality moving; but since he had never touched a woman before, he hesitated for a moment, while his hands were already prepared to reach out for her. (12) And in this moment he heard, shuddering with awe, the voice of his innermost self, and this voice said No. (13) Then, all charms disappeared from the young woman’s smiling face, he no longer saw anything else but the damp glance of a female animal in heat. (14) Politely, he petted her cheek, turned away from her and disappeared away from the disappointed woman with light steps into the bamboo-wood. (15) On this day, he reached the large city before the evening, and was happy, for he felt the need to be among people. (16) For a long time, he had lived in the forests, and the straw hut of the ferryman, in which he had slept that night, had been the first roof for a long time he had had over his head. (17) Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came across a small group of servants, both male and female, carrying baskets. (18) In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful canopy. (19) Siddhartha stopped at the entrance to the pleasure-garden and watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the sedan-chair and saw the lady in it. (20) Under black hair, which made to tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists. (21) Siddhartha saw how beautiful she was, and his heart rejoiced. (22) He bowed deeply, when the sedan-chair came closer, and straightening up again, he looked at the fair, charming face, read for a moment in the smart eyes with the high arcs above, breathed in a slight fragrant, he did not know. (23) With a smile, the beautiful woman nodded for a moment and disappeared into the grove, and then the servants as well. (24) Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen. (25) He instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting. (26) I am still a Samana, he thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar. (27) I must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like this. (28) And he laughed. (29) The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned a house in the city. (30) Then, he entered the city.

Book Title: Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman

Book Author: Thomas Hardy

Paragraph: (1) Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women. (2) In men’s clubs such celebrations were, though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had denuded such women’s clubs as remained (if any other did) or this their glory and consummation. (3) The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the local Cerealia. (4) It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still. (5) The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns—a gay survival from Old Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms—days before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous average. (6) Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional march of two and two round the parish. (7) Ideal and real clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop wore white garments, no two whites were alike among them. (8) Some approached pure blanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the older characters (which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style. (9) In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a bunch of white flowers. (10) The peeling of the former, and the selection of the latter, had been an operation of personal care. (11) There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a jaunty situation. (12) In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say, “I have no pleasure in them,” than of her juvenile comrades. (13) But let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm. (14) The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold, and black, and brown. (15) Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. (16) A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes. (17) And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. (18) They were all cheerful, and many of them merry. (19) They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the women said—



“The Load-a-Lord! (20) Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn’t thy father riding hwome in a carriage!”



A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. (21) She was a fine and handsome girl—not handsomer than some others, possibly—but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape. (22) She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment. (23) As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. (24) This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. (25) Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his head, and singing in a slow recitative—



“I’ve-got-a-gr’t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere—and knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!”



The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess—in whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes. (26) “He’s tired, that’s all,” she said hastily, “and he has got a lift home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.”



“Bless thy simplicity, Tess,” said her companions. (27) “He’s got his market-nitch. (28) Haw-haw!”

“Look here; I won’t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes about him!” Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck. (29) In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped to the ground.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) Little Toomai attended to Kala Nag’s supper, and as evening fell, wandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom. (2) When an Indian child’s heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion. (3) He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. (4) And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! (5) If he had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. (6) But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom—a drum beaten with the flat of the hand—and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he thumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone among the elephant fodder. (7) There was no tune and no words, but the thumping made him happy. (8) The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted from time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God Shiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. (9) It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:



Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,From the King upon theguddeeto the Beggar at the gate.All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.Mahadeo! (10) Mahadeo! (11) He made all—Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine! (12) Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala Nag’s side. (13) At last the elephants began to lie down one after another as is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was left standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the hills. (14) The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together, make one big silence—the click of one bamboo stem against the other, the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk of a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than we imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. (15) Little Toomai slept for some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was still standing up with his ears cocked. (16) Little Toomai turned, rustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against half the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness, the “hoot-toot” of a wild elephant. (17) All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet. (18) One new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag’s leg chain and shackled that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string round Kala Nag’s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. (19) He knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before. (20) Kala Nag did not answer to the order by gurgling, as he usually did. (21) He stood still, looking out across the moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to the great folds of the Garo hills. (22) “Tend to him if he grows restless in the night,” said Big Toomai to Little Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. (23) Little Toomai was just going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a little “tang,” and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. (24) Little Toomai pattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling under his breath, “Kala Nag! (25) Kala Nag! (26) Take me with you, O Kala Nag!” The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the forest. (27) There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. (28) Sometimes a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it. (29) But between those times he moved absolutely without any sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been smoke.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) It fell about her like the texture of a summer cloud, with a kind of vagueness, so that the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately discerned. (2) But the movement of the Veiled Lady was graceful, free, and unembarrassed, like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of thousands; or, possibly, a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with which this dark earthly magician had surrounded her, she was wholly unconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes. (3) Pliant to his gesture (which had even an obsequious courtesy, but at the same time a remarkable decisiveness), the figure placed itself in the great chair. (4) Sitting there, in such visible obscurity, it was, perhaps, as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as anything that stage trickery could devise. (5) The hushed breathing of the spectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the wonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible creature. (6) I, too, was in breathless suspense, but with a far different presentiment of some strange event at hand. (7) ""You see before you the Veiled Lady,"" said the bearded Professor, advancing to the verge of the platform. (8) ""By the agency of which I have just spoken, she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual world. (9) That silvery veil is, in one sense, an enchantment, having been dipped, as it were, and essentially imbued, through the potency of my art, with the fluid medium of spirits. (10) Slight and ethereal as it seems, the limitations of time and space have no existence within its folds. (11) This hall—these hundreds of faces, encompassing her within so narrow an amphitheatre—are of thinner substance, in her view, than the airiest vapor that the clouds are made of. (12) She beholds the Absolute!"". (13) As preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological experiments, the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should endeavor to make the Veiled Lady sensible of their presence by such methods—provided only no touch were laid upon her person—as they might deem best adapted to that end. (14) Accordingly, several deep-lunged country fellows, who looked as if they might have blown the apparition away with a breath, ascended the platform. (15) Mutually encouraging one another, they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a wreath of vanishing mist; they smote upon the floor with bludgeons; they perpetrated so hideous a clamor, that methought it might have reached, at least, a little way into the eternal sphere. (16) Finally, with the assent of the Professor, they laid hold of the great chair, and were startled, apparently, to find it soar upward, as if lighter than the air through which it rose. (17) But the Veiled Lady remained seated and motionless, with a composure that was hardly less than awful, because implying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude persecutors. (18) ""These efforts are wholly without avail,"" observed the Professor, who had been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference. (19) ""The roar of a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the Veiled Lady. (20) And yet, were I to will it, sitting in this very hall, she could hear the desert wind sweeping over the sands as far off as Arabia; the icebergs grinding one against the other in the polar seas; the rustle of a leaf in an East Indian forest; the lowest whispered breath of the bashfullest maiden in the world, uttering the first confession of her love. (21) Nor does there exist the moral inducement, apart from my own behest, that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil, or arise out of that chair."". (22) Greatly to the Professor's discomposure, however, just as he spoke these words, the Veiled Lady arose. (23) There was a mysterious tremor that shook the magic veil. (24) The spectators, it may be, imagined that she was about to take flight into that invisible sphere, and to the society of those purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin. (25) Hollingsworth, a moment ago, had mounted the platform, and now stood gazing at the figure, with a sad intentness that brought the whole power of his great, stern, yet tender soul into his glance. (26) ""Come,"" said he, waving his hand towards her. (27) ""You are safe!"". (28) She threw off the veil, and stood before that multitude of people pale, tremulous, shrinking, as if only then had she discovered that a thousand eyes were gazing at her. (29) Poor maiden!

Book Title: Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman

Book Author: Thomas Hardy

Paragraph: (1) The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near. (2) “Boy, take up that basket! (3) I want ’ee to go on an errand for me.”

The lath-like stripling frowned. (4) “Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me ‘boy’? (5) You know my name as well as I know yours!”

“Do you, do you? (6) That’s the secret—that’s the secret! (7) Now obey my orders, and take the message I’m going to charge ’ee wi’... Well, Fred, I don’t mind telling you that the secret is that I’m one of a noble race—it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.” And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies. (8) The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from crown to toe. (9) “Sir John d’Urberville—that’s who I am,” continued the prostrate man. (10) “That is if knights were baronets—which they be. (11) ’Tis recorded in history all about me. (12) Dost know of such a place, lad, as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?”



“Ees. (13) I’ve been there to Greenhill Fair.”

“Well, under the church of that city there lie—”



“’Tisn’t a city, the place I mean; leastwise ’twaddn’ when I was there—’twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o’ place.”



“Never you mind the place, boy, that’s not the question before us. (14) Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors—hundreds of ’em—in coats of mail and jewels, in gr’t lead coffins weighing tons and tons. (15) There’s not a man in the county o’ South-Wessex that’s got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.”



“Oh?”



“Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you’ve come to The Pure Drop Inn, tell ’em to send a horse and carriage to me immed’ately, to carry me hwome. (16) And in the bottom o’ the carriage they be to put a noggin o’ rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my account. (17) And when you’ve done that goo on to my house with the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn’t finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as I’ve news to tell her.”



As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he possessed. (18) “Here’s for your labour, lad.”

This made a difference in the young man’s estimate of the position. (19) “Yes, Sir John. (20) Thank ’ee. (21) Anything else I can do for ’ee, Sir John?”

“Tell ’em at hwome that I should like for supper,—well, lamb’s fry if they can get it; and if they can’t, black-pot; and if they can’t get that, well chitterlings will do.”



“Yes, Sir John.”



The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village. (22) “What’s that?” said Durbeyfield. (23) “Not on account o’ I?”

“’Tis the women’s club-walking, Sir John. (24) Why, your da’ter is one o’ the members.”

“To be sure—I’d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! (25) Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I’ll drive round and inspect the club.”



The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun. (26) Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills.

Book Title: Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman

Book Author: Thomas Hardy

Paragraph: (1) What would his mother and his brothers say? (2) What would he himself say a couple of years after the event? (3) That would depend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the temporary emotion, or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only, with no substratum of everlastingness. (4) His father’s hill-surrounded little town, the Tudor church-tower of red stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into view beneath him, and he rode down towards the well-known gate. (5) Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his home, he beheld standing by the vestry-door a group of girls, of ages between twelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat older than the school-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and highly-starched cambric morning-gown, with a couple of books in her hand. (6) Clare knew her well. (7) He could not be sure that she observed him; he hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and speak to her, blameless creature that she was. (8) An overpowering reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him. (9) The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his father’s neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents’ quiet hope that he might wed some day. (10) She was great at Antinomianism and Bible-classes, and was plainly going to hold a class now. (11) Clare’s mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var Vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one the most impassioned of them all. (12) It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over to Emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his mother and father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour, before they should have gone out to their parish duties. (13) He was a little late, and they had already sat down to the morning meal. (14) The group at the table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered. (15) They were his father and mother, his brother the Reverend Felix—curate at a town in the adjoining county, home for the inside of a fortnight—and his other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the classical scholar, and Fellow and Dean of his College, down from Cambridge for the long vacation. (16) His mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles, and his father looked what in fact he was—an earnest, God-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixty-five, his pale face lined with thought and purpose. (17) Over their heads hung the picture of Angel’s sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone out to Africa. (18) Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. (19) A spiritual descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted no further reasoning on them thenceforward. (20) He was regarded even by those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying them. (21) He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St James as much as he dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. (22) The New Testament was less a Christiad then a Pauliad to his intelligence—less an argument than an intoxication. (23) His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. (24) He despised the Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles, and deemed himself consistent through the whole category—which in a way he might have been. (25) One thing he certainly was—sincere. (26) To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush womanhood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var Vale, his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it. (27) Once upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in a moment of irritation, that it might have resulted far better for mankind if Greece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization, and not Palestine; and his father’s grief was of that blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth, in such a proposition. (28) He had simply preached austerely at Angel for some time after. (29) But the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long, and welcomed his son to-day with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a child’s. (30) Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) As soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences, I failed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom Hollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us. (2) It now appeared that poor Priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the clouds, as we were at first inclined to suppose. (3) A letter, which should have introduced her, had since been received from one of the city missionaries, containing a certificate of character and an allusion to circumstances which, in the writer's judgment, made it especially desirable that she should find shelter in our Community. (4) There was a hint, not very intelligible, implying either that Priscilla had recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of position, or else that she was still liable to this danger or difficulty, whatever it might be. (5) We should ill have deserved the reputation of a benevolent fraternity, had we hesitated to entertain a petitioner in such need, and so strongly recommended to our kindness; not to mention, moreover, that the strange maiden had set herself diligently to work, and was doing good service with her needle. (6) But a slight mist of uncertainty still floated about Priscilla, and kept her, as yet, from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and blood. (7) The mysterious attraction, which, from her first entrance on our scene, she evinced for Zenobia, had lost nothing of its force. (8) I often heard her footsteps, soft and low, accompanying the light but decided tread of the latter up the staircase, stealing along the passage-way by her new friend's side, and pausing while Zenobia entered my chamber. (9) Occasionally Zenobia would be a little annoyed by Priscilla's too close attendance. (10) In an authoritative and not very kindly tone, she would advise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk, or to go with her work into the barn, holding out half a promise to come and sit on the hay with her, when at leisure. (11) Evidently, Priscilla found but scanty requital for her love. (12) Hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with her. (13) For several minutes together sometimes, while my auditory nerves retained the susceptibility of delicate health, I used to hear a low, pleasant murmur ascending from the room below; and at last ascertained it to be Priscilla's voice, babbling like a little brook to Hollingsworth. (14) She talked more largely and freely with him than with Zenobia, towards whom, indeed, her feelings seemed not so much to be confidence as involuntary affection. (15) I should have thought all the better of my own qualities had Priscilla marked me out for the third place in her regards. (16) But, though she appeared to like me tolerably well, I could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as Hollingsworth and Zenobia were. (17) One forenoon, during my convalescence, there came a gentle tap at my chamber door. (18) I immediately said, ""Come in, Priscilla!"". (19) with an acute sense of the applicant's identity. (20) Nor was I deceived. (21) It was really Priscilla,—a pale, large-eyed little woman (for she had gone far enough into her teens to be, at least, on the outer limit of girlhood), but much less wan than at my previous view of her, and far better conditioned both as to health and spirits. (22) As I first saw her, she had reminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to vegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court, where there is scanty soil and never any sunshine. (23) At present, though with no approach to bloom, there were indications that the girl had human blood in her veins. (24) Priscilla came softly to my bedside, and held out an article of snow-white linen, very carefully and smoothly ironed. (25) She did not seem bashful, nor anywise embarrassed. (26) My weakly condition, I suppose, supplied a medium in which she could approach me.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) Silas Foster, by the time we concluded our meal, had stript off his coat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a lapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own phrase, ""something of a dab"" (whatever degree of skill that may imply) at the shoemaking business. (2) We heard the tap of his hammer at intervals for the rest of the evening. (3) The remainder of the party adjourned to the sitting-room. (4) Good Mrs. Foster took her knitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in brisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing a stocking out of the texture of a dream. (5) And a very substantial stocking it seemed to be. (6) One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel, and the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear, out of a little bit of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably given her. (7) It was curious to observe how trustingly, and yet how timidly, our poor Priscilla betook herself into the shadow of Zenobia's protection. (8) She sat beside her on a stool, looking up every now and then with an expression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty. (9) A brilliant woman is often an object of the devoted admiration—it might almost be termed worship, or idolatry—of some young girl, who perhaps beholds the cynosure only at an awful distance, and has as little hope of personal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven. (10) We men are too gross to comprehend it. (11) Even a woman, of mature age, despises or laughs at such a passion. (12) There occurred to me no mode of accounting for Priscilla's behavior, except by supposing that she had read some of Zenobia's stories (as such literature goes everywhere), or her tracts in defence of the sex, and had come hither with the one purpose of being her slave. (13) There is nothing parallel to this, I believe,—nothing so foolishly disinterested, and hardly anything so beautiful,—in the masculine nature, at whatever epoch of life; or, if there be, a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be looked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such self-forgetful affection. (14) Zenobia happening to change her seat, I took the opportunity, in an undertone, to suggest some such notion as the above. (15) ""Since you see the young woman in so poetical a light,"" replied she in the same tone, ""you had better turn the affair into a ballad. (16) It is a grand subject, and worthy of supernatural machinery. (17) The storm, the startling knock at the door, the entrance of the sable knight Hollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden, who, precisely at the stroke of midnight, shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold water and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers! (18) And when the verses are written, and polished quite to your mind, I will favor you with my idea as to what the girl really is."". (19) ""Pray let me have it now,"" said I; ""it shall be woven into the ballad."". (20) ""She is neither more nor less,"" answered Zenobia, ""than a seamstress from the city; and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than to do my miscellaneous sewing, for I suppose she will hardly expect to make my dresses."". (21) ""How can you decide upon her so easily?"". (22) I inquired. (23) ""Oh, we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of masculine perceptions!"". (24) said Zenobia. (25) ""There is no proof which you would be likely to appreciate, except the needle marks on the tip of her forefinger.

Book Title: The Great Gatsby

Book Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Paragraph: (1) But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. (2) He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room. (3) “Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. (4) I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands. (5) “It’s stopped raining.”

“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. (6) “What do you think of that? (7) It’s stopped raining.”

“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy. (8) “I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”



“You’re sure you want me to come?”



“Absolutely, old sport.”



Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. (9) “My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. (10) “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”



I agreed that it was splendid. (11) “Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. (12) “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”



“I thought you inherited your money.”



“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.”



I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply. (13) “Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. (14) “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. (15) But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. (16) “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”



Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight. (17) “That huge placethere?” she cried pointing. (18) “Do you like it?”

“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”



“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. (19) People who do interesting things. (20) Celebrated people.”

Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. (21) With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. (22) It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. (23) And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. (24) As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. (25) We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. (26) It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. (27) Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. (28) He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. (29) Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.

Book Title: The Brothers Karamazov

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our doctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. (2) The two latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution. (3) The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube. (4) He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdy build. (5) He was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town. (6) He was a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not quite sure which. (7) He had been living amongst us for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. (8) He was a kind‐hearted and humane man. (9) He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he was as obstinate as a mule. (10) If once he had taken an idea into his head, there was no shaking it. (11) Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his presence among us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube’s qualifications. (12) Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty‐five roubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense. (13) All these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme harshness. (14) Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them, “Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? (15) Herzenstube? (16) He, he!” Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three doctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined. (17) Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner’s mental faculties was self‐evident. (18) Then giving his grounds for this opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was not only evident in many of the prisoner’s actions in the past, but was apparent even now at this very moment. (19) When he was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple‐hearted directness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had “an extraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances”; that he had “marched in like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it would have been more natural for him to look to the left where, among the public, the ladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,” the old man concluded in his peculiar language. (20) I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed in German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly, better indeed than Russians. (21) And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world. (22) I may remark, too, that in conversation, through absent‐mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary words, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew them perfectly. (23) The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German, and at such times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had found the missing word. (24) His remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the audience. (25) All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too, that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures. (26) And so his unexpected observation struck every one as very queer. (27) The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner’s mental condition abnormal in the highest degree. (28) He talked at length and with erudition of “aberration” and “mania,” and argued that, from all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several days before his arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him, it must, even if he were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him. (29) But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which premised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (30) (It must be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use of very learned and professional language.)

Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) Very early the next morning, almost before the stars had hidden themselves from view, there was seen standing before Polikey’s home a low wagon, the same in which the superintendent himself used to ride; and harnessed to it was a large-boned, dark-brown mare, called for some unknown reason by the name ofBaraban(drum). (2) Aniutka, Polikey’s eldest daughter, in spite of the heavy rain and the cold wind which was blowing, stood outside barefooted and held (not without some fear) the reins in one hand, while with the other she endeavored to keep her green and yellow overcoat wound around her body, and also to hold Polikey’s sheepskin coat. (3) In the house there were the greatest noise and confusion. (4) The morning was still so dark that the little daylight there was failed to penetrate through the broken panes of glass, the window being stuffed in many places with rags and paper to exclude the cold air. (5) Akulina ceased from her cooking for a while and helped to get Polikey ready for the journey. (6) Most of the children were still in bed, very likely as a protection against the cold, for Akulina had taken away the big overcoat which usually covered them and had substituted a shawl of her own. (7) Polikey’s shirt was all ready, nice and clean, but his shoes badly needed repairing, and this fact caused his devoted wife much anxiety. (8) She took from her own feet the thick woollen stockings she was wearing, and gave them to Polikey. (9) She then began to repair his shoes, patching up the holes so as to protect his feet from dampness. (10) While this was going on he was sitting on the side of the bed with his feet dangling over the edge, and trying to turn the sash which confined his coat at the waist. (11) He was anxious to look as clean as possible, and he declared his sash looked like a dirty rope. (12) One of his daughters, enveloped in a sheepskin coat, was sent to a neighbor’s house to borrow a hat. (13) Within Polikey’s home the greatest confusion reigned, for the court servants were constantly arriving with innumerable small orders which they wished Polikey to execute for them in town. (14) One wanted needles, another tea, another tobacco, and last came the joiner’s wife, who by this time had prepared her samovar, and, anxious to make up the quarrel of the previous day, brought the traveller a cup of tea. (15) Neighbor Nikita refused the loan of the hat, so the old one had to be patched up for the occasion. (16) This occupied some time, as there were many holes in it. (17) Finally Polikey was all ready, and jumping on the wagon started on his journey, after first making the sign of the cross. (18) At the last moment his little boy, Mishka, ran to the door, begging to be given a short ride; and then his little daughter, Mashka, appeared on the scene and pleaded that she, too, might have a ride, declaring that she would be quite warm enough without furs. (19) Polikey stopped the horse on hearing the children, and Akulina placed them in the wagon, together with two others belonging to a neighbor—all anxious to have a short ride. (20) As Akulina helped the little ones into the wagon she took occasion to remind Polikey of the solemn promise he had made her not to touch a drop of vodka during the journey. (21) Polikey drove the children as far as the blacksmith’s place, where he let them out of the wagon, telling them they must return home. (22) He then arranged his clothing, and, setting his hat firmly on his head, started his horse on a trot. (23) The two children, Mishka and Mashka, both barefooted, started running at such a rapid pace that a strange dog from another village, seeing them flying over the road, dropped his tail between his legs and ran home squealing. (24) The weather was very cold, a sharp cutting wind blowing continuously; but this did not disturb Polikey, whose mind was engrossed with pleasant thoughts. (25) As he rode through the wintry blasts he kept repeating to himself: “So I am the man they wanted to send to Siberia, and whom they threatened to enroll as a soldier—the same man whom every one abused, and said he was lazy, and who was pointed out as a thief and given the meanest work on the estate to do! (26) Now I am going to receive a large sum of money, for which my mistress is sending me because she trusts me.

Book Title: The Brothers Karamazov

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s house. (2) But, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he took towards the house. (3) There was nothing strange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what was the cause of it. (4) He had often been depressed before, and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown future. (5) He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had great hopes, and great—too great—expectations from life, he could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires. (6) Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something quite different. (7) “Is it loathing for my father’s house?” he wondered. (8) “Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it’s the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it’s not that either. (9) Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with him? (10) For so many years I’ve been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.” It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity—vexation at having failed to express himself, especially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning. (11) No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. (12) “I feel sick with depression and yet I can’t tell what I want. (13) Better not think, perhaps.”

Ivan tried “not to think,” but that, too, was no use. (14) What made his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual, external character—he felt that. (15) Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous one—some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on. (16) At last, feeling very cross and ill‐humored, Ivan arrived home, and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was fretting and worrying him. (17) On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soul loathed. (18) It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. (19) Just before, when Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred responsive anger in his heart. (20) Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again. (21) “Is it possible that a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?” he wondered, with insufferable irritation. (22) It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the man, especially during the last few days. (23) He had even begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature. (24) Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. (25) Then he had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. (26) He had encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the brain of “the contemplative.” They discussed philosophical questions and even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be understood.

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) Tomorrow, oh Govinda, I’ll leave you.”



For a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long time, they lay there and found no sleep. (2) And over and over again, Govinda urged his friend, he should tell him why he would not want to seek refuge in Gotama’s teachings, what fault he would find in these teachings. (3) But Siddhartha turned him away every time and said: “Be content, Govinda! (4) Very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how could I find a fault in them?”



Very early in the morning, a follower of Buddha, one of his oldest monks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of their position. (5) Then Govinda broke loose, embraced once again his childhood friend and left with the novices. (6) But Siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought. (7) Then he happened to meet Gotama, the exalted one, and when he greeted him with respect and the Buddha’s glance was so full of kindness and calm, the young man summoned his courage and asked the venerable one for the permission to talk to him. (8) Silently the exalted one nodded his approval. (9) Quoth Siddhartha: “Yesterday, oh exalted one, I had been privileged to hear your wondrous teachings. (10) Together with my friend, I had come from afar, to hear your teachings. (11) And now my friend is going to stay with your people, he has taken his refuge with you. (12) But I will again start on my pilgrimage.”

“As you please,” the venerable one spoke politely. (13) “Too bold is my speech,” Siddhartha continued, “but I do not want to leave the exalted one without having honestly told him my thoughts. (14) Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?”



Silently, the Buddha nodded his approval. (15) Quoth Siddhartha: “One thing, oh most venerable one, I have admired in your teachings most of all. (16) Everything in your teachings is perfectly clear, is proven; you are presenting the world as a perfect chain, a chain which is never and nowhere broken, an eternal chain the links of which are causes and effects. (17) Never before, this has been seen so clearly; never before, this has been presented so irrefutably; truly, the heart of every Brahman has to beat stronger with love, once he has seen the world through your teachings perfectly connected, without gaps, clear as a crystal, not depending on chance, not depending on gods. (18) Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be suffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not essential—but the uniformity of the world, that everything which happens is connected, that the great and the small things are all encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your exalted teachings, oh perfected one. (19) But according to your very own teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation. (20) But with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and uniform law of the world is breaking apart again and becomes void. (21) Please forgive me for expressing this objection.”



Quietly, Gotama had listened to him, unmoved. (22) Now he spoke, the perfected one, with his kind, with his polite and clear voice: “You’ve heard the teachings, oh son of a Brahman, and good for you that you’ve thought about it thus deeply. (23) You’ve found a gap in it, an error. (24) You should think about this further. (25) But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge, of the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words. (26) There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them. (27) But the teachings, you’ve heard from me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those who seek knowledge. (28) They have a different goal; their goal is salvation from suffering. (29) This is what Gotama teaches, nothing else.”

“I wish that you, oh exalted one, would not be angry with me,” said the young man.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? (2) Bad one! (3) Wicked one! (4) Worthless son! (5) Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no thorns in his feet. (6) Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter—a follower of elephant’s foot tracks, a jungle bear. (7) Bah! (8) Shame! (9) Go!”

Little Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all his grievances while he was examining his feet. (10) “No matter,” said Little Toomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag’s huge right ear. (11) “They have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps—and perhaps—and perhaps—who knows? (12) Hai! (13) That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!”

The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or lost in the forest. (14) Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to pay the drivers their wages. (15) As each man was paid he went back to his elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. (16) The catchers, and hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in the jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that belonged to Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, or leaned against the trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and ran about. (17) Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and Machua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his, “There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. (18) ’Tis a pity to send that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.”



Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens to the most silent of all living things—the wild elephant. (19) He turned where he was lying all along on Pudmini’s back and said, “What is that? (20) I did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope even a dead elephant.”



“This is not a man, but a boy. (21) He went into the Keddah at the last drive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.”



Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and Little Toomai bowed to the earth. (22) “He throw a rope? (23) He is smaller than a picket-pin. (24) Little one, what is thy name?” said Petersen Sahib. (25) Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him, and Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in his trunk and held him level with Pudmini’s forehead, in front of the great Petersen Sahib. (26) Then Little Toomai covered his face with his hands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were concerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be. (27) “Oho!” said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, “and why didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? (28) Was it to help thee steal green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?”



“Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,—melons,” said Little Toomai. (29) “Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,—melons,” said Little Toomai, and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their bark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight. (2) There were creepers hanging from the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. (3) But within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of green—nothing but the trampled earth. (4) The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants stood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. (5) Little Toomai looked, holding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he looked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks. (6) Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to swim. (7) Outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts. (8) There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young elephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights, and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger’s claws on his side. (9) They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves—scores and scores of elephants. (10) Toomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag’s neck nothing would happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame elephant. (11) And these elephants were not thinking of men that night. (12) Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib’s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. (13) She must have broken her pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahib’s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. (14) He, too, must have run away from some camp in the hills about. (15) At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about. (16) Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs. (17) Still lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling eyes. (18) He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tails. (19) Then a cloud came over the moon, and he sat in black darkness. (20) But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and gurgling went on just the same. (21) He knew that there were elephants all round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the assembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. (22) In a Keddah at least there was torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee. (23) Then an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds. (24) The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. (25) But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground—one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. (26) The elephants were stamping all together now, and it sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. (27) The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound. (28) But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him—this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. (29) Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again.

Book Title: The Great Gatsby

Book Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Paragraph: (1) Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands. (2) “I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. (3) “How long were we in there?”

“Why, about an hour.”



“It was… simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. (4) “But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my face. (5) “Please come and see me… Phone book… Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… My aunt…” She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door. (6) Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. (7) I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. (8) “Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. (9) “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. (10) “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.”



Then the butler, behind his shoulder:



“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”



“All right, in a minute. (11) Tell them I’ll be right there… Good night.”

“Good night.”



“Good night.”

 He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. (12) “Good night, old sport… Good night.”

But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. (13) Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. (14) In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. (15) The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. (16) However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene. (17) A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way. (18) “See!” he explained. (19) “It went in the ditch.”

The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library. (20) “How’d it happen?”

He shrugged his shoulders. (21) “I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively. (22) “But how did it happen? (23) Did you run into the wall?”

“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. (24) “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. (25) It happened, and that’s all I know.”

“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”



“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”



An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. (26) “Do you want to commit suicide?”

“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! (27) A bad driver and not eventrying!”

“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. (28) “I wasn’t driving. (29) There’s another man in the car.”

The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.

Book Title: Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman

Book Author: Thomas Hardy

Paragraph: (1) Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground, and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil. (2) The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many other waggons with families on the summit of the load, which was built on a wellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee. (3) The groundwork of the arrangement was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles, and finger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood importantly in front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its erect and natural position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they were bound to carry reverently. (4) Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers. (5) During the halt Tess’s eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn. (6) She followed one of the mug’s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew. (7) Tess went towards the waggon. (8) “Marian and Izz!” she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged. (9) “Are you house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?”



They were, they said. (10) It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose. (11) They told Tess their destination, and Tess told them hers. (12) Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. (13) “Do you know that the gentleman who follows ’ee—you’ll guess who I mean—came to ask for ’ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? (14) We didn’t tell’n where you was, knowing you wouldn’t wish to see him.”



“Ah—but I did see him!” Tess murmured. (15) “He found me.”

“And do he know where you be going?”



“I think so.”



“Husband come back?”



“No.”



She bade her acquaintance goodbye—for the respective carters had now come out from the inn—and the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the ploughman’s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only. (16) The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one’s coming. (17) The distance was great—too great for a day’s journey—and it was with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. (18) Though they had started so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called Greenhill. (19) While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess looked around. (20) Under the hill, and just ahead of them, was the half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere, where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the d’Urbervilles’ home, since they had resided there for full five hundred years. (21) A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and when he beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his steps. (22) “You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?” he said to Tess’s mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way. (23) She nodded. (24) “Though widow of the late Sir John d’Urberville, poor nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of his forefathers.”



“Oh? (25) Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield, I am sent to tell ’ee that the rooms you wanted be let. (26) We didn’t know that you was coming till we got your letter this morning—when ’twas too late. (27) But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.”



The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at his intelligence. (28) Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. (29) “What shall we do now, Tess?” she said bitterly.

Book Title: The Great Gatsby

Book Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Paragraph: (1) Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. (2) My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month. (3) Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. (4) Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. (5) And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago. (6) Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. (7) His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. (8) It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. (9) Why they came East I don’t know. (10) They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. (11) This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game. (12) And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. (13) Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. (14) The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. (15) The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. (16) He had changed since his New Haven years. (17) Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. (18) Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. (19) Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. (20) It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body. (21) His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. (22) There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. (23) “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. (24) We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. (25) “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. (26) Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore. (27) “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. (28) “We’ll go inside.”

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. (29) The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. (30) A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for the Sea Catch. (2) All the same, I wish they’d hurry.”

It was weary work for Kotick. (3) The herd never went more than forty or fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and under them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. (4) As they went farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were following up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more. (5) One night they sank through the shiny water—sank like stones—and for the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. (6) Kotick followed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow was anything of a swimmer. (7) They headed for a cliff by the shore—a cliff that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. (8) It was a long, long swim, and Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they led him through. (9) “My wig!” he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at the farther end. (10) “It was a long dive, but it was worth it.”

The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. (11) There were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men had ever come there. (12) The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good, and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. (13) Away to the northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel. (14) “It’s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,” said Kotick. (15) “Sea Cow must be wiser than I thought. (16) Men can’t come down the cliffs, even if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters. (17) If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.”

He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new country, so that he would be able to answer all questions. (18) Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to the southward. (19) No one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them. (20) He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when he hauled out just above Sea Lion’s Neck the first person he met was the seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found his island at last. (21) But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young seal about his own age said, “This is all very well, Kotick, but you can’t come from no one knows where and order us off like this. (22) Remember we’ve been fighting for our nurseries, and that’s a thing you never did. (23) You preferred prowling about in the sea.”

The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his head from side to side. (24) He had just married that year, and was making a great fuss about it. (25) “I’ve no nursery to fight for,” said Kotick. (26) “I only want to show you all a place where you will be safe. (27) What’s the use of fighting?”

“Oh, if you’re trying to back out, of course I’ve no more to say,” said the young seal with an ugly chuckle. (28) “Will you come with me if I win?” said Kotick. (29) And a green light came into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all. (30) “Very good,” said the young seal carelessly.

Book Title: Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman

Book Author: Thomas Hardy

Paragraph: (1) Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed, abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a man’s, though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference of indecision. (2) Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague, in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern about his material future. (3) Yet as a lad people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he tried. (4) He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end of the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months’ pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming, with a view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as circumstances might decide. (5) His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step in the young man’s career which had been anticipated neither by himself nor by others. (6) Mr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him a daughter, married a second late in life. (7) This lady had somewhat unexpectedly brought him three sons, so that between Angel, the youngest, and his father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation. (8) Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training. (9) Some two or three years before Angel’s appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller’s, directed to the Reverend James Clare. (10) The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm. (11) “Why has this been sent to my house?” he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. (12) “It was ordered, sir.”

“Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.”



The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. (13) “Oh, it has been misdirected, sir,” he said. (14) “It was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.”



Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. (15) He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. (16) “Look into this book, my boy,” he said. (17) “What do you know about it?”

“I ordered it,” said Angel simply. (18) “What for?”

“To read.”



“How can you think of reading it?”



“How can I? (19) Why—it is a system of philosophy. (20) There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.”



“Yes—moral enough; I don’t deny that. (21) But religious! (22) and foryou, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!”



“Since you have alluded to the matter, father,” said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, “I should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders. (23) I fear I could not conscientiously do so. (24) I love the Church as one loves a parent. (25) I shall always have the warmest affection for her. (26) There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.”



It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! (27) He was stultified, shocked, paralysed. (28) And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge?

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) But his enemies and disbelievers said, this Gotama was a vain seducer, who spent his days in luxury, scorned the offerings, was without learning, and knew neither exercises nor self-castigation. (2) The myth of Buddha sounded sweet. (3) The scent of magic flowed from these reports. (4) After all, the world was sick, life was hard to bear—and behold, here a source seemed to spring forth, here a messenger seemed to call out, comforting, mild, full of noble promises. (5) Everywhere where the rumour of Buddha was heard, everywhere in the lands of India, the young men listened up, felt a longing, felt hope, and among the Brahmans’ sons of the towns and villages every pilgrim and stranger was welcome, when he brought news of him, the exalted one, the Sakyamuni. (6) The myth had also reached the Samanas in the forest, and also Siddhartha, and also Govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden with hope, every drop laden with doubt. (7) They rarely talked about it, because the oldest one of the Samanas did not like this myth. (8) He had heard that this alleged Buddha used to be an ascetic before and had lived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly pleasures, and he had no high opinion of this Gotama. (9) “Oh Siddhartha,” Govinda spoke one day to his friend. (10) “Today, I was in the village, and a Brahman invited me into his house, and in his house, there was the son of a Brahman from Magadha, who has seen the Buddha with his own eyes and has heard him teach. (11) Verily, this made my chest ache when I breathed, and thought to myself: If only I would too, if only we both would too, Siddhartha and me, live to see the hour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected man! (12) Speak, friend, wouldn’t we want to go there too and listen to the teachings from the Buddha’s mouth?”



Quoth Siddhartha: “Always, oh Govinda, I had thought, Govinda would stay with the Samanas, always I had believed his goal was to live to be sixty and seventy years of age and to keep on practising those feats and exercises, which are becoming a Samana. (13) But behold, I had not known Govinda well enough, I knew little of his heart. (14) So now you, my faithful friend, want to take a new path and go there, where the Buddha spreads his teachings.”



Quoth Govinda: “You’re mocking me. (15) Mock me if you like, Siddhartha! (16) But have you not also developed a desire, an eagerness, to hear these teachings? (17) And have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk the path of the Samanas for much longer?”



At this, Siddhartha laughed in his very own manner, in which his voice assumed a touch of sadness and a touch of mockery, and said: “Well, Govinda, you’ve spoken well, you’ve remembered correctly. (18) If you only remembered the other thing as well, you’ve heard from me, which is that I have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning, and that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is small. (19) But let’s do it, my dear, I am willing to listen to these teachings—though in my heart I believe that we’ve already tasted the best fruit of these teachings.”



Quoth Govinda: “Your willingness delights my heart. (20) But tell me, how should this be possible? (21) How should the Gotama’s teachings, even before we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?”



Quoth Siddhartha: “Let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh Govinda! (22) But this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the Gotama, consisted in him calling us away from the Samanas! (23) Whether he has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await with calm hearts.”



On this very same day, Siddhartha informed the oldest one of the Samanas of his decision, that he wanted to leave him. (24) He informed the oldest one with all the courtesy and modesty becoming to a younger one and a student. (25) But the Samana became angry, because the two young men wanted to leave him, and talked loudly and used crude swearwords. (26) Govinda was startled and became embarrassed. (27) But Siddhartha put his mouth close to Govinda’s ear and whispered to him: “Now, I want to show the old man that I’ve learned something from him.”



Positioning himself closely in front of the Samana, with a concentrated soul, he captured the old man’s glance with his glances, deprived him of his power, made him mute, took away his free will, subdued him under his own will, commanded him, to do silently, whatever he demanded him to do. (28) The old man became mute, his eyes became motionless, his will was paralysed, his arms were hanging down; without power, he had fallen victim to Siddhartha’s spell. (29) But Siddhartha’s thoughts brought the Samana under their control, he had to carry out, what they commanded.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) Now Rann the Kite brings home the nightThat Mang the Bat sets free—The herds are shut in byre and hutFor loosed till dawn are we.This is the hour of pride and power,Talon and tush and claw.Oh, hear the call! (2) Good hunting allThat keep the Jungle Law!Night-Song in the Jungle



It was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. (3) Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. (4) “Augrh!” said Father Wolf. (5) “It is time to hunt again.” He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. (6) And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.”



“Good luck go with you, O chief of the wolves.”



It was the jackal—Tabaqui, the Dish-licker—and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. (7) But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. (8) Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. (9) We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee—the madness—and run. (10) “Enter, then, and look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but there is no food here.”



“For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. (11) Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?” He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily. (12) “All thanks for this good meal,” he said, licking his lips. (13) “How beautiful are the noble children! (14) How large are their eyes! (15) And so young too! (16) Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.”



Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. (17) It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. (18) Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully:



“Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. (19) He will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.”



Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty miles away. (20) “He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily—“By the Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. (21) He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I—I have to kill for two, these days.”



“His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,” said Mother Wolf quietly. (22) “He has been lame in one foot from his birth. (23) That is why he has only killed cattle.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) But I ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an individual who sat two or three seats below me, immovable, apparently deep in thought, with his back, of course, towards me, and his face turned steadfastly upon the platform. (2) After sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar contour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches, lay my hand on his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address him in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: ""Hollingsworth! (3) where have you left Zenobia?"". (4) His nerves, however, were proof against my attack. (5) He turned half around, and looked me in the face with great sad eyes, in which there was neither kindness nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise. (6) ""Zenobia, when I last saw her,"" he answered, ""was at Blithedale."". (7) He said no more. (8) But there was a great deal of talk going on near me, among a knot of people who might be considered as representing the mysticism, or rather the mystic sensuality, of this singular age. (9) The nature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably given the turn to their conversation. (10) I heard, from a pale man in blue spectacles, some stranger stories than ever were written in a romance; told, too, with a simple, unimaginative steadfastness, which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor to receive them into the category of established facts. (11) He cited instances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and passions of another; insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow beneath the influence of a man possessing this potency, and the strong love of years melted away like a vapor. (12) At the bidding of one of these wizards, the maiden, with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips, would turn from him with icy indifference; the newly made widow would dig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the sods had taken root upon it; a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom would thrust away her child. (13) Human character was but soft wax in his hands; and guilt, or virtue, only the forms into which he should see fit to mould it. (14) The religious sentiment was a flame which he could blow up with his breath, or a spark that he could utterly extinguish. (15) It is unutterable, the horror and disgust with which I listened, and saw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was virtually annihilated, and all that is sweet and pure in our present life debased, and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was made ridiculous, and immortality rendered at once impossible, and not worth acceptance. (16) But I would have perished on the spot sooner than believe it. (17) The epoch of rapping spirits, and all the wonders that have followed in their train,—such as tables upset by invisible agencies, bells self-tolled at funerals, and ghostly music performed on jew's-harps,—had not yet arrived. (18) Alas, my countrymen, methinks we have fallen on an evil age! (19) If these phenomena have not humbug at the bottom, so much the worse for us. (20) What can they indicate, in a spiritual way, except that the soul of man is descending to a lower point than it has ever before reached while incarnate? (21) We are pursuing a downward course in the eternal march, and thus bring ourselves into the same range with beings whom death, in requital of their gross and evil lives, has degraded below humanity! (22) To hold intercourse with spirits of this order, we must stoop and grovel in some element more vile than earthly dust. (23) These goblins, if they exist at all, are but the shadows of past mortality, outcasts, mere refuse stuff, adjudged unworthy of the eternal world, and, on the most favorable supposition, dwindling gradually into nothingness. (24) The less we have to say to them the better, lest we share their fate! (25) The audience now began to be impatient; they signified their desire for the entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of boot-heels. (26) Nor was it a great while longer before, in response to their call, there appeared a bearded personage in Oriental robes, looking like one of the enchanters of the Arabian Nights. (27) He came upon the platform from a side door, saluted the spectators, not with a salaam, but a bow, took his station at the desk, and first blowing his nose with a white handkerchief, prepared to speak. (28) The environment of the homely village hall, and the absence of many ingenious contrivances of stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off, seemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the surface. (29) No sooner did I behold the bearded enchanter, than, laying my hand again on Hollingsworth's shoulder, I whispered in his ear, ""Do you know him? (30) "".

Book Title: The Brothers Karamazov

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) It was resolved to act with energy. (2) The deputy police inspector of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitch’s house and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regular forms, which I will not go into here. (3) The district doctor, a zealous man, new to his work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, the prosecutor, and the investigating lawyer. (4) I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead, with his skull battered in. (5) But with what? (6) Most likely with the same weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. (7) And immediately that weapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at once given, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knocked down. (8) They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path. (9) There were no signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. (10) But by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and thick envelope with the inscription: “A present of three thousand roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.” And below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, “For my little chicken.” There were three seals of red sealing‐wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open and was empty: the money had been removed. (11) They found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up. (12) One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch’s evidence made a great impression on the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded them before him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc. (13) When Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell some one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: “You’ll be too late.” So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before he really did shoot himself. (14) “That’s clear, that’s clear!” repeated the prosecutor in great excitement. (15) “That’s just the way with mad fellows like that: ‘I shall kill myself to‐ morrow, so I’ll make merry till I die!’ ”



The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the prosecutor more than ever. (16) “Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev, gentlemen? (17) He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair curled, and then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his hand in the same way, he went off to the girls.”



All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. (18) It all took time and so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in the town the morning before to get his pay. (19) He was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the “criminal” till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also witnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on. (20) Mavriky Mavrikyevitch did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no one but his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of his secret business. (21) He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the landlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once a change in Trifon Borissovitch’s face and voice. (22) So neither Mitya nor any one else knew that he was being watched. (23) The box with the pistols had been carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. (24) Only after four o’clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain, the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each drawn by three horses. (25) The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s to make a post‐mortem next day on the body. (26) But he was particularly interested in the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov. (27) “Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for twenty‐four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to science,” he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they left they laughingly congratulated him on his find. (28) The prosecutor and the investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor’s saying that Smerdyakov could not outlive the night. (29) After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off.

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) They had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words; with a smile, he remembered them. (2) For a long time he knew that there was nothing standing between Gotama and him any more, though he was still unable to accept his teachings. (3) No, there was no teaching a truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept. (4) But he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path, every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what is divine. (5) On one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying Buddha, Kamala also went to him, who used to be the most beautiful of the courtesans. (6) A long time ago, she had retired from her previous life, had given her garden to the monks of Gotama as a gift, had taken her refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of the pilgrims. (7) Together with Siddhartha the boy, her son, she had gone on her way due to the news of the near death of Gotama, in simple clothes, on foot. (8) With her little son, she was travelling by the river; but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining. (9) Kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having his way against her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to scold him. (10) He did not comprehend why he had to go on this exhausting and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger, who was holy and about to die. (11) So what if he died, how did this concern the boy? (12) The pilgrims were getting close to Vasudeva’s ferry, when little Siddhartha once again forced his mother to rest. (13) She, Kamala herself, had also become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes a bit, and rested. (14) But suddenly, she uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her in fear and saw her face having grown pale from horror; and from under her dress, a small, black snake fled, by which Kamala had been bitten. (15) Hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach people, and got near to the ferry, there Kamala collapsed, and was not able to go any further. (16) But the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for help, until the sound reached Vasudeva’s ears, who stood at the ferry. (17) Quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, where Siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire. (18) He looked up and first saw the boy’s face, which wondrously reminded him of something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten. (19) Then he saw Kamala, whom he instantly recognised, though she lay unconscious in the ferryman’s arms, and now he knew that it was his own son, whose face had been such a warning reminder to him, and the heart stirred in his chest. (20) Kamala’s wound was washed, but had already turned black and her body was swollen, she was made to drink a healing potion. (21) Her consciousness returned, she lay on Siddhartha’s bed in the hut and bent over her stood Siddhartha, who used to love her so much. (22) It seemed like a dream to her; with a smile, she looked at her friend’s face; just slowly she, realized her situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy. (23) “He’s with you, don’t worry,” said Siddhartha. (24) Kamala looked into his eyes. (25) She spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed by the poison. (26) “You’ve become old, my dear,” she said, “you’ve become gray. (27) But you are like the young Samana, who at one time came without clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden. (28) You are much more like him than you were like him at that time when you had left me and Kamaswami. (29) In the eyes, you’re like him, Siddhartha.

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) They rarely spoke to one another, than the service and the exercises required. (2) Occasionally the two of them went through the villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers. (3) “How do you think, Govinda,” Siddhartha spoke one day while begging this way, “how do you think did we progress? (4) Did we reach any goals?”

Govinda answered: “We have learned, and we’ll continue learning. (5) You’ll be a great Samana, Siddhartha. (6) Quickly, you’ve learned every exercise, often the old Samanas have admired you. (7) One day, you’ll be a holy man, oh Siddhartha.”

Quoth Siddhartha: “I can’t help but feel that it is not like this, my friend. (8) What I’ve learned, being among the Samanas, up to this day, this, oh Govinda, I could have learned more quickly and by simpler means. (9) In every tavern of that part of a town where the whorehouses are, my friend, among carters and gamblers I could have learned it.”



Quoth Govinda: “Siddhartha is putting me on. (10) How could you have learned meditation, holding your breath, insensitivity against hunger and pain there among these wretched people?”



And Siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself: “What is meditation? (11) What is leaving one’s body? (12) What is fasting? (13) What is holding one’s breath? (14) It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. (15) The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk. (16) Then he won’t feel his self any more, then he won’t feel the pains of life any more, then he finds a short numbing of the senses. (17) When he falls asleep over his bowl of rice-wine, he’ll find the same what Siddhartha and Govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises, staying in the non-self. (18) This is how it is, oh Govinda.”

Quoth Govinda: “You say so, oh friend, and yet you know that Siddhartha is no driver of an ox-cart and a Samana is no drunkard. (19) It’s true that a drinker numbs his senses, it’s true that he briefly escapes and rests, but he’ll return from the delusion, finds everything to be unchanged, has not become wiser, has gathered no enlightenment,—has not risen several steps.”



And Siddhartha spoke with a smile: “I do not know, I’ve never been a drunkard. (20) But that I, Siddhartha, find only a short numbing of the senses in my exercises and meditations and that I am just as far removed from wisdom, from salvation, as a child in the mother’s womb, this I know, oh Govinda, this I know.”



And once again, another time, when Siddhartha left the forest together with Govinda, to beg for some food in the village for their brothers and teachers, Siddhartha began to speak and said: “What now, oh Govinda, might we be on the right path? (21) Might we get closer to enlightenment? (22) Might we get closer to salvation? (23) Or do we perhaps live in a circle—we, who have thought we were escaping the cycle?”



Quoth Govinda: “We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. (24) We are not going around in circles, we are moving up, the circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level.”



Siddhartha answered: “How old, would you think, is our oldest Samana, our venerable teacher?”



Quoth Govinda: “Our oldest one might be about sixty years of age.”



And Siddhartha: “He has lived for sixty years and has not reached the nirvana. (25) He’ll turn seventy and eighty, and you and me, we will grow just as old and will do our exercises, and will fast, and will meditate. (26) But we will not reach the nirvana, he won’t and we won’t. (27) Oh Govinda, I believe out of all the Samanas out there, perhaps not a single one, not a single one, will reach the nirvana. (28) We find comfort, we find numbness, we learn feats, to deceive others. (29) But the most important thing, the path of paths, we will not find.”



“If you only,” spoke Govinda, “wouldn’t speak such terrible words, Siddhartha! (30) How could it be that among so many learned men, among so many Brahmans, among so many austere and venerable Samanas, among so many who are searching, so many who are eagerly trying, so many holy men, no one will find the path of paths?”



But Siddhartha said in a voice which contained just as much sadness as mockery, with a quiet, a slightly sad, a slightly mocking voice: “Soon, Govinda, your friend will leave the path of the Samanas, he has walked along your side for so long.

Book Title: Anne of Green Gables

Book Author: L.M. Montgomery

Paragraph: (1) The boys, who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of all. (2) Anne could run like a deer, however; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr. Phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat. (3) Mr. Phillips’s brief reforming energy was over; he didn’t want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance. (4) “Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys’ company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,” he said sarcastically. (5) “Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.”



The other boys snickered. (6) Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the wreath from Anne’s hair and squeezed her hand. (7) Anne stared at the master as if turned to stone. (8) “Did you hear what I said, Anne?” queried Mr. Phillips sternly. (9) “Yes, sir,” said Anne slowly “but I didn’t suppose you really meant it.”



“I assure you I did”—still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children, and Anne especially, hated. (10) It flicked on the raw. (11) “Obey me at once.”

For a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. (12) Then, realizing that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms on the desk. (13) Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home from school that she’d “acksually never seen anything like it—it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.”



To Anne, this was as the end of all things. (14) It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable. (15) Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try. (16) Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation. (17) At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged. (18) But as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. (19) When Mr. Phillips called the history class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and Mr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses “To Priscilla” before he called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her. (20) Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, “You are sweet,” and slipped it under the curve of Anne’s arm. (21) Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert. (22) When school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate. (23) “What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?” Diana wanted to know, as soon as they were out on the road. (24) She had not dared to ask the question before. (25) “I am not coming back to school any more,” said Anne. (26) Diana gasped and stared at Anne to see if she meant it. (27) “Will Marilla let you stay home?” she asked. (28) “She’ll have to,” said Anne. (29) “I’llnevergo to school to that man again.”

“Oh, Anne!” Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. (30) “I do think you’re mean.

Book Title: The Great Gatsby

Book Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Paragraph: (1) The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. (2) The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. (3) He had changed since his New Haven years. (4) Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. (5) Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. (6) Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. (7) It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body. (8) His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. (9) There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. (10) “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. (11) We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. (12) “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. (13) Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore. (14) “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. (15) “We’ll go inside.”

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. (16) The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. (17) A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. (18) The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. (19) They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. (20) I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. (21) Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. (22) The younger of the two was a stranger to me. (23) She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. (24) If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in. (25) The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. (26) “I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”

She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. (27) That was a way she had. (28) She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (29) (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) (30) At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright.

Book Title: The Blithedale Romance

Book Author: Nathaniel Hawthorne

Paragraph: (1) They are very deep and dreamy to-night."". (2) I know not whether the following version of her story will retain any portion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and rapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities which I am too timorous to repeat,—giving it the varied emphasis of her inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile face, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the thoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,—thus narrated, and thus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair. (3) I scarcely knew, at the time, whether she intended us to laugh or be more seriously impressed. (4) From beginning to end, it was undeniable nonsense, but not necessarily the worse for that. (5) You have heard, my dear friends, of the Veiled Lady, who grew suddenly so very famous, a few months ago. (6) And have you never thought how remarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish, all at once, while her renown was on the increase, before the public had grown weary of her, and when the enigma of her character, instead of being solved, presented itself more mystically at every exhibition? (7) Her last appearance, as you know, was before a crowded audience. (8) The next evening,—although the bills had announced her, at the corner of every street, in red letters of a gigantic size,—there was no Veiled Lady to be seen! (9) Now, listen to my simple little tale, and you shall hear the very latest incident in the known life—(if life it may be called, which seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of one's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane)—the life of this shadowy phenomenon. (10) A party of young gentlemen, you are to understand, were enjoying themselves, one afternoon,—as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of doing,—over a bottle or two of champagne; and, among other ladies less mysterious, the subject of the Veiled Lady, as was very natural, happened to come up before them for discussion. (11) She rose, as it were, with the sparkling effervescence of their wine, and appeared in a more airy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they saw her. (12) They repeated to one another, between jest and earnest, all the wild stories that were in vogue; nor, I presume, did they hesitate to add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment might suggest, to heighten the marvellousness of their theme. (13) ""But what an audacious report was that,"" observed one, ""which pretended to assert the identity of this strange creature with a young lady,""—and here he mentioned her name,—""the daughter of one of our most distinguished families!"". (14) ""Ah, there is more in that story than can well be accounted for,"" remarked another. (15) ""I have it on good authority, that the young lady in question is invariably out of sight, and not to be traced, even by her own family, at the hours when the Veiled Lady is before the public; nor can any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance. (16) And just look at the thing: Her brother is a young fellow of spirit. (17) He cannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister. (18) Why, then, does he not come forward to defend her character, unless he is conscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse?"". (19) It is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of these young gentlemen from his companions; so, for the sake of a soft and pretty name (such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably bestow upon our heroes), I deem it fit to call him Theodore. (20) ""Pshaw!"". (21) exclaimed Theodore; ""her brother is no such fool! (22) Nobody, unless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine, can seriously think of crediting that ridiculous rumor. (23) Why, if my senses did not play me false (which never was the case yet), I affirm that I saw that very lady, last evening, at the exhibition, while this veiled phenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks! (24) What can you say to that?"". (25) ""Oh, it was a spectral illusion that you saw!"". (26) replied his friends, with a general laugh. (27) ""The Veiled Lady is quite up to such a thing."". (28) However, as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against Theodore's downright refutation, they went on to speak of other stories which the wild babble of the town had set afloat. (29) Some upheld that the veil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world; others,—and certainly with more reason, considering the sex of the Veiled Lady,—that the face was the most hideous and horrible, and that this was her sole motive for hiding it. (30) It was the face of a corpse; it was the head of a skeleton; it was a monstrous visage, with snaky locks, like Medusa's, and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead.

Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) The old devil, failing to ruin Ivan’s kingdom with soldiers, transformed himself into a nobleman, dressed exquisitely, and became one of Ivan’s subjects, with the intention of compassing the downfall of his kingdom—as he had done with that of Tarras. (2) The “nobleman” said to Ivan: “I desire to teach you wisdom and to render you other service. (3) I will build you a palace and factories.”

“Very well,” said Ivan; “you may live with us.”



The next day the “nobleman” appeared on the Square with a sack of gold in his hand and a plan for building a house, saying to the people: “You are living like pigs, and I am going to teach you how to live decently. (4) You are to build a house for me according to this plan. (5) I will superintend the work myself, and will pay you for your services in gold,” showing them at the same time the contents of his sack. (6) The fools were amused. (7) They had never before seen any money. (8) Their business was conducted entirely by exchange of farm products or by hiring themselves out to work by the day in return for whatever they most needed. (9) They therefore glanced at the gold pieces with amazement, and said, “What nice toys they would be to play with!” In return for the gold they gave their services and brought the “nobleman” the produce of their farms. (10) The old devil was overjoyed as he thought, “Now my enterprise is on a fair road and I will be able to ruin the Fool—as I did his brothers.”



The fools obtained sufficient gold to distribute among the entire community, the women and young girls of the village wearing much of it as ornaments, while to the children they gave some pieces to play with on the streets. (11) When they had secured all they wanted they stopped working and the “nobleman” did not get his house more than half finished. (12) He had neither provisions nor cattle for the year, and ordered the people to bring him both. (13) He directed them also to go on with the building of the palace and factories. (14) He promised to pay them liberally in gold for everything they did. (15) No one responded to his call—only once in awhile a little boy or girl would call to exchange eggs for his gold. (16) Thus was the “nobleman” deserted, and, having nothing to eat, he went to the village to procure some provisions for his dinner. (17) He went to one house and offered gold in return for a chicken, but was refused, the owner saying: “We have enough of that already and do not want any more.”



He next went to a fish-woman to buy some herring, when she, too, refused to accept his gold in return for fish, saying: “I do not wish it, my dear man; I have no children to whom I can give it to play with. (18) I have three pieces which I keep as curiosities only.”



He then went to a peasant to buy bread, but he also refused to accept the gold. (19) “I have no use for it,” said he, “unless you wish to give it for Christ’s sake; then it will be a different matter, and I will tell mybaba[old woman] to cut a piece of bread for you.”



The old devil was so angry that he ran away from the peasant, spitting and cursing as he went. (20) Not only did the offer to accept in the name of Christ anger him, but the very mention of the name was like the thrust of a knife in his throat. (21) The old devil did not succeed in getting any bread, and in his efforts to secure other articles of food he met with the same failure. (22) The people had all the gold they wanted and what pieces they had they regarded as curiosities. (23) They said to the old devil: “If you bring us something else in exchange for food, or come to ask for Christ’s sake, we will give you all you want.”



But the old devil had nothing but gold, and was too lazy to work; and being unable to accept anything for Christ’s sake, he was greatly enraged. (24) “What else do you want?” he said.

Book Title: Anne of Green Gables

Book Author: L.M. Montgomery

Paragraph: (1) HE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was getting ready to go to Queen’s, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be talked over and arranged. (2) Anne’s outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. (3) More—one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material. (4) “Anne, here’s something for a nice light dress for you. (5) I don’t suppose you really need it; you’ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe you’d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. (6) I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got ‘evening dresses,’ as they call them, and I don’t mean you shall be behind them. (7) I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town last week, and we’ll get Emily Gillis to make it for you. (8) Emily has got taste, and her fits aren’t to be equaled.”



“Oh, Marilla, it’s just lovely,” said Anne. (9) “Thank you so much. (10) I don’t believe you ought to be so kind to me—it’s making it harder every day for me to go away.”



The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily’s taste permitted. (11) Anne put it on one evening for Matthew’s and Marilla’s benefit, and recited “The Maiden’s Vow” for them in the kitchen. (12) As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes. (13) Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla’s own eyes. (14) “I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,” said Anne gaily stooping over Marilla’s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady’s cheek. (15) “Now, I call that a positive triumph.”

“No, I wasn’t crying over your piece,” said Marilla, who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. (16) “I just couldn’t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. (17) And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways. (18) You’ve grown up now and you’re going away; and you look so tall and stylish and so—so—different altogether in that dress—as if you didn’t belong in Avonlea at all—and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.”



“Marilla!” Anne sat down on Marilla’s gingham lap, took Marilla’s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla’s eyes. (19) “I’m not a bit changed—not really. (20) I’m only just pruned down and branched out. (21) The realme—back here—is just the same.

Book Title: Siddhartha

Book Author: Hermann Hesse

Paragraph: (1) It was since that time, when he had stopped being a Samana in his heart, that Siddhartha began to play the game for money and precious things, which he at other times only joined with a smile and casually as a custom of the childlike people, with an increasing rage and passion. (2) He was a feared gambler, few dared to take him on, so high and audacious were his stakes. (3) He played the game due to a pain of his heart, losing and wasting his wretched money in the game brought him an angry joy, in no other way he could demonstrate his disdain for wealth, the merchants’ false god, more clearly and more mockingly. (4) Thus he gambled with high stakes and mercilessly, hating himself, mocking himself, won thousands, threw away thousands, lost money, lost jewelry, lost a house in the country, won again, lost again. (5) That fear, that terrible and petrifying fear, which he felt while he was rolling the dice, while he was worried about losing high stakes, that fear he loved and sought to always renew it, always increase it, always get it to a slightly higher level, for in this feeling alone he still felt something like happiness, something like an intoxication, something like an elevated form of life in the midst of his saturated, lukewarm, dull life. (6) And after each big loss, his mind was set on new riches, pursued the trade more zealously, forced his debtors more strictly to pay, because he wanted to continue gambling, he wanted to continue squandering, continue demonstrating his disdain of wealth. (7) Siddhartha lost his calmness when losses occurred, lost his patience when he was not paid on time, lost his kindness towards beggars, lost his disposition for giving away and loaning money to those who petitioned him. (8) He, who gambled away tens of thousands at one roll of the dice and laughed at it, became more strict and more petty in his business, occasionally dreaming at night about money! (9) And whenever he woke up from this ugly spell, whenever he found his face in the mirror at the bedroom’s wall to have aged and become more ugly, whenever embarrassment and disgust came over him, he continued fleeing, fleeing into a new game, fleeing into a numbing of his mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he fled back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions. (10) In this pointless cycle he ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill.



Then the time came when a dream warned him. (11) He had spent the hours of the evening with Kamala, in her beautiful pleasure-garden. (12) They had been sitting under the trees, talking, and Kamala had said thoughtful words, words behind which a sadness and tiredness lay hidden. (13) She had asked him to tell her about Gotama, and could not hear enough of him, how clear his eyes, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his smile, how peaceful his walk had been. (14) For a long time, he had to tell her about the exalted Buddha, and Kamala had sighed and had said: “One day, perhaps soon, I’ll also follow that Buddha. (15) I’ll give him my pleasure-garden for a gift and take my refuge in his teachings.” But after this, she had aroused him, and had tied him to her in the act of making love with painful fervour, biting and in tears, as if, once more, she wanted to squeeze the last sweet drop out of this vain, fleeting pleasure. (16) Never before, it had become so strangely clear to Siddhartha, how closely lust was akin to death. (17) Then he had lain by her side, and Kamala’s face had been close to him, and under her eyes and next to the corners of her mouth he had, as clearly as never before, read a fearful inscription, an inscription of small lines, of slight grooves, an inscription reminiscent of autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed, here and there, gray hairs among his black ones. (18) Tiredness was written on Kamala’s beautiful face, tiredness from walking a long path, which has no happy destination, tiredness and the beginning of withering, and concealed, still unsaid, perhaps not even conscious anxiety: fear of old age, fear of the autumn, fear of having to die. (19) With a sigh, he had bid his farewell to her, the soul full of reluctance, and full of concealed anxiety. (20) Then, Siddhartha had spent the night in his house with dancing girls and wine, had acted as if he was superior to them, towards the fellow-members of his caste, though this was no longer true, had drunk much wine and gone to bed a long time after midnight, being tired and yet excited, close to weeping and despair, and had for a long time sought to sleep in vain, his heart full of misery which he thought he could not bear any longer, full of a disgust which he felt penetrating his entire body like the lukewarm, repulsive taste of the wine, the just too sweet, dull music, the just too soft smile of the dancing girls, the just too sweet scent of their hair and breasts. (21) But more than by anything else, he was disgusted by himself, by his perfumed hair, by the smell of wine from his mouth, by the flabby tiredness and listlessness of his skin. (22) Like when someone, who has eaten and drunk far too much, vomits it back up again with agonising pain and is nevertheless glad about the relief, thus this sleepless man wished to free himself of these pleasures, these habits and all of this pointless life and himself, in an immense burst of disgust. (23) Not until the light of the morning and the beginning of the first activities in the street before his city-house, he had slightly fallen asleep, had found for a few moments a half unconsciousness, a hint of sleep. (24) In those moments, he had a dream:

Kamala owned a small, rare singing bird in a golden cage. (25) Of this bird, he dreamt. (26) He dreamt: this bird had become mute, who at other times always used to sing in the morning, and since this arose his attention, he stepped in front of the cage and looked inside; there the small bird was dead and lay stiff on the ground. (27) He took it out, weighed it for a moment in his hand, and then threw it away, out in the street, and in the same moment, he felt terribly shocked, and his heart hurt, as if he had thrown away from himself all value and everything good by throwing out this dead bird. (28) Starting up from this dream, he felt encompassed by a deep sadness. (29) Worthless, so it seemed to him, worthless and pointless was the way he had been going through life; nothing which was alive, nothing which was in some way delicious or worth keeping he had left in his hands. (30) Alone he stood there and empty like a castaway on the shore.

Book Title: The Brothers Karamazov

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) How’s that? (2) Why, when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.”



“Who knows it? (3) Who counted the money? (4) Did I let any one count it?”

“Why, you told every one yourself that you’d spent exactly three thousand.”



“It’s true, I did. (5) I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so. (6) And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. (7) Yet I didn’t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. (8) And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. (9) That’s how it was, gentlemen. (10) That’s where I got that money yesterday....”

“This is almost miraculous,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch. (11) “Allow me to inquire,” observed the prosecutor at last, “have you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?”



“I told no one.”



“That’s strange. (12) Do you mean absolutely no one?”

“Absolutely no one. (13) No one and nobody.”

“What was your reason for this reticence? (14) What was your motive for making such a secret of it? (15) To be more precise: You have told us at last your secret, in your words, so ‘disgraceful,’ though in reality—that is, of course, comparatively speaking—this action, that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration your character.... (16) Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not ‘disgraceful.’... (17) Many people have already guessed, during this last month, about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna’s, that you have spent, and I heard the legend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but the gossip of the whole town. (18) There are indications, too, if I am not mistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna’s, and so, it’s extremely surprising to me that hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... It’s not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than confessing it ...”



The prosecutor ceased speaking. (19) He was provoked. (20) He did not conceal his vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words. (21) “It’s not the fifteen hundred that’s the disgrace, but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand,” said Mitya firmly. (22) “Why?” smiled the prosecutor irritably. (23) “What is there disgraceful, to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer, ‘disgracefully,’ appropriated? (24) Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it. (25) And by the way, why did you do that—why did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for what object did you do it? (26) Can you explain that to us?”

“Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!” cried Mitya. (27) “I put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month.”



“It’s incomprehensible.”



“I wonder at you. (28) But I’ll make it clearer. (29) Perhaps it really is incomprehensible. (30) You see, attend to what I say.

Book Title: The Brothers Karamazov

Book Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Paragraph: (1) “Even this must have a preface—that is, a literary preface,” laughed Ivan, “and I am a poor hand at making one. (2) You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. (3) Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. (4) In those days it was done in all simplicity. (5) In Victor Hugo’sNotre Dame de Parisan edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. (6) in honor of the birth of the dauphin. (7) It was calledLe bon jugement de la très sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces herbon jugement. (8) Similar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of Peter the Great. (9) But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when required. (10) In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such poems—and even under the Tatars. (11) There is, for instance, one such poem (of course, from the Greek),The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell, with descriptions as bold as Dante’s. (12) Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel Michael leads her through the torments. (13) She sees the sinners and their punishment. (14) There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they can’t swim out, and ‘these God forgets’—an expression of extraordinary depth and force. (15) And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell—for all she has seen there, indiscriminately. (16) Her conversation with God is immensely interesting. (17) She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God points to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, ‘How can I forgive His tormentors?’ she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction. (18) It ends by her winning from God a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, ‘Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.’ Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. (19) He comes on the scene in my poem, but He says nothing, only appears and passes on. (20) Fifteen centuries have passed since He promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet wrote, ‘Behold, I come quickly’; ‘Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the Father,’ as He Himself predicted on earth. (21) But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. (22) Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven. (23) No signs from heaven come to‐dayTo add to what the heart doth say. (24) There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. (25) It is true there were many miracles in those days. (26) There were saints who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. (27) But the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles.

Book Title: The Great Gatsby

Book Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Paragraph: (1) About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say. (2) “Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely. (3) “Why—any statement to give out.”

It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. (4) This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”



It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right. (5) Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. (6) Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. (7) Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say. (8) James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. (9) He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. (10) It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to theTuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour. (11) I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. (12) His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. (13) The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. (14) He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. (15) So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. (16) For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. (17) His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. (18) He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted. (19) But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. (20) The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. (21) A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. (22) Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. (23) For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing. (24) An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota.

(2) Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies’ eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde’s Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof. (3) There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbor’s business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. (4) She was a notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she “ran” the Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. (5) Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting “cotton warp” quilts—she had knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices—and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond. (6) Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel’s all-seeing eye. (7) She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. (8) The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. (9) Thomas Lynde—a meek little man whom Avonlea people called “Rachel Lynde’s husband”—was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. (10) Mrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blair’s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon. (11) Peter had asked him, of course, for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life. (12) And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. (13) Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there? (14) Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. (15) But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk. (16) Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn’t happen often. (17) Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon’s enjoyment was spoiled. (18) “I’ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he’s gone and why,” the worthy woman finally concluded. (19) “He doesn’t generally go to town this time of year and henevervisits; if he’d run out of turnip seed he wouldn’t dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasn’t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. (20) Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. (21) I’m clean puzzled, that’s what, and I won’t know a minute’s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today.”



Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde’s Hollow. (22) To be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. (23) Matthew Cuthbert’s father, as shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead. (24) Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. (25) Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a placelivingat all. (26) “It’s juststaying, that’s what,” she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. (27) “It’s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves.

Book Title: The Jungle Book

Book Author: Rudyard Kipling

Paragraph: (1) He is too big. (2) “Give me permission to come with you,” said Kaa. (3) “A blow more or less is nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I—I have to wait and wait for days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a young ape. (4) Psshaw! (5) The branches are not what they were when I was young. (6) Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.”

“Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,” said Baloo. (7) “I am a fair length—a fair length,” said Kaa with a little pride. (8) “But for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. (9) I came very near to falling on my last hunt—very near indeed—and the noise of my slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names.”



“Footless, yellow earth-worm,” said Bagheera under his whiskers, as though he were trying to remember something. (10) “Sssss! (11) Have they ever called me that?” said Kaa. (12) “Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we never noticed them. (13) They will say anything—even that thou hast lost all thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)—because thou art afraid of the he-goat’s horns,” Bagheera went on sweetly. (14) Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of Kaa’s throat ripple and bulge. (15) “The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,” he said quietly. (16) “When I came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.”



“It—it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,” said Baloo, but the words stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the monkeys. (17) “Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters—leaders in their own jungle I am certain—on the trail of the Bandar-log,” Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity. (18) “Indeed,” Baloo began, “I am no more than the old and sometimes very foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera here—”



“Is Bagheera,” said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap, for he did not believe in being humble. (19) “The trouble is this, Kaa. (20) Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.”



“I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. (21) Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told.”



“But it is true. (22) He is such a man-cub as never was,” said Baloo. (23) “The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs—my own pupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I—we—love him, Kaa.”



“Ts! (24) Ts!” said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. (25) “I also have known what love is. (26) There are tales I could tell that—”

“That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,” said Bagheera quickly. (27) “Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.”



“They fear me alone. (28) They have good reason,” said Kaa. (29) “Chattering, foolish, vain—vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys.

Book Title: The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) Those with great welts on their hands she invited first to the table, and those having smooth white hands had to take what was left. (2) The old devil took a seat at the table, but the dumb girl, taking his hands, looked at them, and seeing them white and clean, and with long nails, swore at him and put him from the table. (3) Ivan’s wife said to the old devil: “You must excuse my sister-in-law; she will not allow any one to sit at the table whose hands have not been hardened by toil, so you will have to wait until the dinner is over and then you can have what is left. (4) With it you must be satisfied.”

The old devil was very much offended that he was made to eat with “pigs,” as he expressed it, and complained to Ivan, saying: “The foolish law you have in your kingdom, that all persons must work, is surely the invention of fools. (5) People who work for a living are not always forced to labor with their hands. (6) Do you think wise men labor so?”

Ivan replied: “Well, what do fools know about it? (7) We all work with our hands.”

“And for that reason you are fools,” replied the devil. (8) “I can teach you how to use your brains, and you will find such labor more beneficial.”



Ivan was surprised at hearing this, and said: “Well, it is perhaps not without good reason that we are called fools.”



“It is not so easy to work with the brain,” the old devil said. (9) “You will not give me anything to eat because my hands have not the appearance of being toil-hardened, but you must understand that it is much harder to do brain-work, and sometimes the head feels like bursting with the effort it is forced to make.”



“Then why do you not select some light work that you can perform with your hands?” Ivan asked. (10) The devil said: “I torment myself with brain-work because I have pity for you fools, for, if I did not torture myself, people like you would remain fools for all eternity. (11) I have exercised my brain a great deal during my life, and now I am able to teach you.”



Ivan was greatly surprised and said: “Very well; teach us, so that when our hands are tired we can use our heads to replace them.”



The devil promised to instruct the people, and Ivan announced the fact throughout his kingdom. (12) The devil was willing to teach all those who came to him how to use the head instead of the hands, so as to produce more with the former than with the latter. (13) In Ivan’s kingdom there was a high tower, which was reached by a long, narrow ladder leading up to the balcony, and Ivan told the old devil that from the top of the tower every one could see him. (14) So the old devil went up to the balcony and addressed the people. (15) The fools came in great crowds to hear what the old devil had to say, thinking that he really meant to tell them how to work with the head. (16) But the old devil only told them in words what to do, and did not give them any practical instruction. (17) He said that men working only with their hands could not make a living. (18) The fools did not understand what he said to them and looked at him in amazement, and then departed for their daily work. (19) The old devil addressed them for two days from the balcony, and at the end of that time, feeling hungry, he asked the people to bring him some bread. (20) But they only laughed at him and told him if he could work better with his head than with his hands he could also find bread for himself. (21) He addressed the people for yet another day, and they went to hear him from curiosity, but soon left him to return to their work. (22) Ivan asked, “Well, did the nobleman work with his head?”



“Not yet,” they said; “so far he has only talked.”



One day, while the old devil was standing on the balcony, he became weak, and, falling down, hurt his head against a pole. (23) Seeing this, one of the fools ran to Ivan’s wife and said, “The gentleman has at last commenced to work with his head.”



She ran to the field to tell Ivan, who was much surprised, and said, “Let us go and see him.”



He turned his horses’ heads in the direction of the tower, where the old devil remained weak from hunger and was still suspended from the pole, with his body swaying back and forth and his head striking the lower part of the pole each time it came in contact with it. (24) While Ivan was looking, the old devil started down the steps head-first—as they supposed, to count them. (25) “Well,” said Ivan, “he told the truth after all—that sometimes from this kind of work the head bursts. (26) This is far worse than welts on the hands.”

The old devil fell to the ground head-foremost. (27) Ivan approached him, but at that instant the ground opened and the devil disappeared, leaving only a hole to show where he had gone. (28) Ivan scratched his head and said: “See here; such nastiness! (29) This is yet another devil. (30) He looks like the father of the little ones.”

Ivan still lives, and people flock to his kingdom.

Book Title: Anne of Green Gables

Book Author: L.M. Montgomery

Paragraph: (1) If I don’t grow up right I can’t go back and begin over again. (2) I’ve grown two inches this summer, Marilla. (3) Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby’s party. (4) I’m so glad you made my new dresses longer. (5) That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. (6) Of course I know it wasn’t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses. (7) I know I’ll be able to study better because of mine. (8) I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce.”



“It’s worth something to have that,” admitted Marilla. (9) Miss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more. (10) Especially did the Queen’s class gird up their loins for the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as “the Entrance,” at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes. (11) Suppose they did not pass! (12) That thought was doomed to haunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems. (13) When Anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe’s name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all. (14) But it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. (15) Schoolwork was as interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. (16) New worlds of thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne’s eager eyes. (17) “Hills peeped o’er hill and Alps on Alps arose.”

Much of all this was due to Miss Stacy’s tactful, careful, broadminded guidance. (18) She led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously. (19) Apart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of the Spencervale doctor’s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings. (20) The Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore. (21) Between times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl was taller than herself. (22) “Why, Anne, how you’ve grown!” she said, almost unbelievingly. (23) A sigh followed on the words. (24) Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne’s inches. (25) The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head, in her place. (26) Marilla loved the girl as much as she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss. (27) And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting with Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry. (28) Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through her tears. (29) “I was thinking about Anne,” she explained. (30) “She’s got to be such a big girl—and she’ll probably be away from us next winter.
