Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. (2) My friend Robert could not resist. (3) They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which he did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain. (4) She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. (5) He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own. (6) This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. (7) Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her. (8) She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman’s language can make interesting. (9) In our communications we deal only in the great. (10) However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s heart seemed forhim, and tome, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”



He stopped. (11) Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. (12) To speak, she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness. (13) She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. (14) Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,



“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. (15) His situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more. (16) His good sense and good principles would delight you. (17) As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands. (18) His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma. (19) You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”



He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,



“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. (20) I think Harriet is doing extremely well.Herconnexions may be worse thanhis. (21) In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. (22) I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. (23) You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! (24) how peculiarly unprepared I was! (25) for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him, much more, than she was before.”



“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”



Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe you know her quite as well as I do. (26) But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downrightacceptedhim. (27) I could suppose she might in time—but can she already? (28) Did not you misunderstand him? (29) You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him? (30) It was not Harriet’s hand that he was certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”



The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, “No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,” that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. (31) It could not be otherwise. (32) “Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. (33) “Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of? (34) What do you deserve?”

“Oh! (35) I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. (36) Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?”



“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so. (37) He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. (38) He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends. (39) Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? (40) I assured him that I could not. (41) Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”



“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, “and most sincerely wish them happy.”



“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”



“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”



“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet’s good qualities. (42) I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. (2) I was curious to look into it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me. (3) But I must confess to you I made more haste out than I did in when, looking farther into the place, and which wasperfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection. (4) However, after some pause I recovered myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years on an island all alone, and that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself. (5) Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand. (6) I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. (7) I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it off. (8) But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life; and dying, indeed, of mere old age. (9) I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and Ithought with myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would certainly frighten any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him. (10) I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look around me, when I found the cave was but very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or square, no hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature. (11) I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither I went I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come again the next day, provided with candles and a tinderbox, which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild-fire in the pan. (12) Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my own making, for I made very good candles now of goat’s tallow; and going into this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. (13) When I was got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet. (14) But never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave; the walls reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. (15) What it was in the rock, whether diamonds,or any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew not. (16) The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark. (17) The floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen; neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. (18) The only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight in all. (19) So I kept at my castle only five, which stood ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence; and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. (20) Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took occasion to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which caking, and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask. (21) And this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind.I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets. (22) I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here, if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or, if they did, they would not venture to attack me here. (23) The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent offense to my nose. (24) I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island; and was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. (25) I had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before. (26) As, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six and twenty years. (27) How long he might live afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. (28) Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe to thisday. (29) I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. (30) My dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself. (2) We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder, and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. (3) It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship’s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they after great labor and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them closeunder our stern, and got all into their boat. (4) It was to no purpose for them or us after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship, so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could, and our master promised them that if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good to their master; so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the norward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness. (5) We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. (6) I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go in; my heart was as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me. (7) While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see, when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore, a great many people running along the shore to assist us when we should come near. (8) But we made but slow way towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the shore, till being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind. (9) Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity as well by the magistrates of the town, whoassigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought fit. (10) Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our blessed Savior’s parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had any assurance that I was not drowned. (11) But my ill-fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. (12) I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. (13) Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt. (14) My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the master’s son, was now less forward than I. (15) The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters—I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered, and looking very melancholy and shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father whoI was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial in order to get farther abroad, his father turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone, “Young man,” said he, “you ought never to go to sea any more, you ought to take this for a plain and visible token, that you are not to be a seafaring man.” “Why, sir,” said I, “will you go to sea no more?” “That is another case,” said he; “it is my calling, and therefore, my duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. (16) Pray,” continued he, “what are you? (17) and on what account did you go to sea?” Upon that I told him some of my story, at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion. (18) “What had I done,” said he, “that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship? (19) I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds.” This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go. (20) However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. (21) “And, young man,” said he, “depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your father’s words are fulfilled upon you.”



We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no more; which way he went, I know not. (22) Asfor me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should go home, or go to sea. (23) As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at among the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often observed how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men. (24) In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. (25) An irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. (26) That evil influence which carried me first away from my father’s house, that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even command of my father—I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented themost unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea. (27) It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship myself as a sailor, whereby, though I might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the duty and office of a foremast man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. (28) But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, or learned to do any. (29) It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London, which does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them very early; but it was not so with me. (30) I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who, taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his companion; and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the trade would permit, and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side of the island, and I was not without secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancying the seeing the mainland, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some means of escape. (2) But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could not be far off from that shore. (3) Suppose they were not cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty together, much more I, that was but one, and could make little or no defence; all these things, I say, whichI ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions at first, but my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore. (4) Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. (5) Then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. (6) She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy rough sand, but no water about her, as before. (7) If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island. (8) However, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to try what I could do; suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her down, I might easily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. (9) I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. (10) At last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it falldown, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. (11) But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was forced to give it over. (12) And yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible. (13) This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make myself a canoe, orperiagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz., of the trunk of a great tree. (14) This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the water, a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them. (15) For what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with much trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the water? (16) One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance while I was making this boat, but I should have immediately thought how Ishould get it into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get it off of the land; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. (17) I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did who had any of his senses awake. (18) I pleased myself with the design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it. (19) Not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer which I gave myself, “Let’s first make it! (20) I’ll warrant I’ll find some way or other to get it along when ’tis done.”



This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. (21) I felled a cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple of Jerusalem. (22) It was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for awhile, and then parted into branches.

Book Title: The Count of Monte Cristo

Book Author: Alexandre Dumas

Paragraph: (1) “Really, M. de Blacas, I must change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape, and bearing this device—Tenax.”



“Sire, I listen,” said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience. (2) “I wish to consult you on this passage, ‘Molli fugiens anhelitu,’ you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. (3) Are you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter? (4) Well, then, what do you think of themolli anhelitu?”



“Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.”



“Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and that without getting in the least out of breath.”



“Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information. (5) If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.”



“M. (6) de Salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?”

“Yes, sire.”





“He is at Marseilles.”



“And writes me thence.”



“Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?”



“No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him to your majesty.”



“M. (7) de Villefort!” cried the king, “is the messenger’s name M. de Villefort?”



“Yes, sire.”





“And he comes from Marseilles?”



“In person.”



“Why did you not mention his name at once?” replied the king, betraying some uneasiness. (8) “Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.”



“No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding, ambitious, too, and,pardieu!you know his father’s name!”



“His father?”



“Yes, Noirtier.”



“Noirtier the Girondin? (9) Noirtier the senator?”

“He himself.”



“And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?”



“Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. (10) I told you Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything, even his father.”



“Then, sire, may I present him?”



“This instant, duke! (11) Where is he?”

“Waiting below, in my carriage.”



“Seek him at once.”



“I hasten to do so.”



The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again. (12) Louis XVIII. (13) remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:



“Justum et tenacem propositi virum.”



M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king’s authority. (14) Villefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire. (15) The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort was introduced. (16) The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. (17) On opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young magistrate’s first impulse was to pause. (18) “Come in, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “come in.”



Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him. (19) “M. (20) de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.”



“Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it equally important.”



“In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”



“Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have used, that it is not irreparable.”



“Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face and affected Villefort’s voice. (21) “Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like order in everything.”



“Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor, and he went on:



“Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne. (22) Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. (23) At this moment he will have left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France. (24) Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?”



“I am, sir,” said the king, much agitated; “and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques. (25) But proceed, I beg of you. (26) How did you obtain these details?”

“Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the day of my departure. (27) This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. (28) There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”



“And where is this man?”



“In prison, sire.”



“And the matter seems serious to you?”



“So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.”



“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”



“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”



“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”



“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”



“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. (29) For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. (30) If Bonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. (31) Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.”



“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas.

Book Title: The Count of Monte Cristo

Book Author: Alexandre Dumas

Paragraph: (1) t will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel. (2) The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after Villefort’s departure, his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind. (3) Even Ali, who had hastened to obey the Count’s summons, went forth from his master’s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron’s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master’s happy reverie. (4) It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of Haydée, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations. (5) The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count. (6) The rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions, that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose. (7) Haydée had three French maids, and one who was a Greek. (8) The first three remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave, who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress’s wishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen. (9) The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments. (10) This was a sort of boudoir, circular, and lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass. (11) Haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin spotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water. (12) Her attitude, though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect. (13) Her dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair of white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have been taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls. (14) She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps. (15) The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves, whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles. (16) Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored silk, embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue. (17) The extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and purely Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely formed nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race and country. (18) And, to complete the whole, Haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms—she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers. (19) Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. (20) Haydée’s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl’s picturesque attitude and appearance. (21) As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said, with a smile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken by the women of Athens and Sparta:



“Why demand permission ere you enter? (22) Are you no longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?”



Monte Cristo returned her smile. (23) “Haydée,” said he, “you well know.”

“Why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?” asked the young Greek. (24) “Have I by any means displeased you?

Book Title: The Count of Monte Cristo

Book Author: Alexandre Dumas

Paragraph: (1) He had assigned himself the task of saving a man’s life that day; chance caused that man to be myself. (2) When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti.”



“Yes,” said Morrel, smiling, “it was the 5th of September, the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved; therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by some——”



“Heroic action,” interrupted Château-Renaud. (3) “I was chosen. (4) But that is not all—after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold, not by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the whole; then from hunger by sharing with me—guess what?”



“A Strasbourg pie?” asked Beauchamp. (5) “No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite. (6) It was very hard.”

“The horse?” said Morcerf, laughing. (7) “No, the sacrifice,” returned Château-Renaud; “ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?”



“Not for a stranger,” said Debray, “but for a friend I might, perhaps.”



“I divined that you would become mine, count,” replied Morrel; “besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.”



“The history to which M. Morrel alludes,” continued Château-Renaud, “is an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our memories. (8) What time do you breakfast, Albert?”

“At half-past ten.”



“Precisely?” asked Debray, taking out his watch. (9) “Oh, you will give me five minutes’ grace,” replied Morcerf, “for I also expect a preserver.”



“Of whom?”



“Of myself,” cried Morcerf; “parbleu!do you think I cannot be saved as well as anyone else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads? (10) Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table—at least, I hope so—two benefactors of humanity.”



“What shall we do?” said Debray; “we have only one Monthyon prize.”



“Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,” said Beauchamp; “that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the dilemma.”



“And where does he come from?” asked Debray. (11) “You have already answered the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second time.”



“Really,” said Albert, “I do not know; when I invited him three months ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may have gone?”



“And you think him capable of being exact?” demanded Debray. (12) “I think him capable of everything.”

“Well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.”



“I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.”



“I beg pardon,” interrupted Beauchamp; “are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?”



“Yes, and for a most curious one.”



“Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and I must make up for it.”



“I was at Rome during the last Carnival.”



“We know that,” said Beauchamp. (13) “Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.”



“There are no bandits,” cried Debray. (14) “Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I found them ugly enough to frighten me.”



“Come, my dear Albert,” said Debray, “confess that your cook is behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes, and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish by a story. (15) Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.”



“And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one from beginning to end. (16) The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.”



“I know it,” said Château-Renaud; “I narrowly escaped catching a fever there.”



“And I did more than that,” replied Morcerf, “for I caught one. (17) I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman crowns—about 24,000 francs. (18) Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. (19) I was at the end of my journey and of my credit. (20) I wrote to Franz—and were he here he would confirm every word—I wrote then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such was the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously kept his word.”



“But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,” said Château-Renaud. (21) “A man whose name is Franz d’Épinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.”



“No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you.”



“Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing Andromeda.”



“No, he is a man about my own size.”



“Armed to the teeth?”



“He had not even a knitting-needle.”



“But he paid your ransom?”



“He said two words to the chief and I was free.”



“And they apologized to him for having carried you off?” said Beauchamp. (22) “Just so.”

“Why, he is a second Ariosto.”



“No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.”



“There is no Count of Monte Cristo” said Debray. (23) “I do not think so,” added Château-Renaud, with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly. (24) “Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?”



“He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.”



“I think I can assist your researches,” said Maximilian. (25) “Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.”



“Precisely!” cried Albert. (26) “Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tuscany.”



“He is rich, then?”



“I believe so.”



“But that ought to be visible.”



“That is what deceives you, Debray.”



“I do not understand you.”



“Have you read theArabian Nights?”



“What a question!”



“Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? (27) They seem like poor fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the Indies.”



“Which means?”



“Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. (28) He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.”



“And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?” asked Beauchamp. (29) “No, but Franz has; for heaven’s sake, not a word of this before him. (30) Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) For this marriage to Casaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.”



“Oh, on my own account—it is for Miss Brooke’s sake I think her friends should try to use their influence.”



“Well, Humphrey doesn’t know yet. (2) But when I tell him, you may depend on it he will say, ‘Why not? (3) Casaubon is a good fellow—and young—young enough.’ These charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they have swallowed it and got the colic. (4) However, if I were a man I should prefer Celia, especially when Dorothea was gone. (5) The truth is, you have been courting one and have won the other. (6) I can see that she admires you almost as much as a man expects to be admired. (7) If it were any one but me who said so, you might think it exaggeration. (8) Good-by!”

Sir James handed Mrs. Cadwallader to the phaeton, and then jumped on his horse. (9) He was not going to renounce his ride because of his friend’s unpleasant news—only to ride the faster in some other direction than that of Tipton Grange. (10) Now, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about Miss Brooke’s marriage; and why, when one match that she liked to think she had a hand in was frustrated, should she have straightway contrived the preliminaries of another? (11) Was there any ingenious plot, any hide-and-seek course of action, which might be detected by a careful telescopic watch? (12) Not at all: a telescope might have swept the parishes of Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in her phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could excite suspicion, or any scene from which she did not return with the same unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color. (13) In fact, if that convenient vehicle had existed in the days of the Seven Sages, one of them would doubtless have remarked, that you can know little of women by following them about in their pony-phaetons. (14) Even with a microscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making interpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a weak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity into which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so many animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain tiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the swallower waits passively at his receipt of custom. (15) In this way, metaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to Mrs. Cadwallader’s match-making will show a play of minute causes producing what may be called thought and speech vortices to bring her the sort of food she needed. (16) Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either foul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected by the great affairs of the world. (17) All the more did the affairs of the great world interest her, when communicated in the letters of high-born relations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the dogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young Lord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the exact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new branch and widened the relations of scandal,—these were topics of which she retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced them in an excellent pickle of epigrams, which she herself enjoyed the more because she believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as she did in game and vermin. (18) She would never have disowned any one on the ground of poverty: a De Bracy reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have seemed to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I fear his aristocratic vices would not have horrified her. (19) But her feeling towards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred: they had probably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs. Cadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in kind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God’s design in making the world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. (20) A town where such monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy, which could not be taken account of in a well-bred scheme of the universe. (21) Let any lady who is inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader inquire into the comprehensiveness of her own beautiful views, and be quite sure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have the honor to coexist with hers. (22) With such a mind, active as phosphorus, biting everything that came near into the form that suited it, how could Mrs. Cadwallader feel that the Miss Brookes and their matrimonial prospects were alien to her? (23) especially as it had been the habit of years for her to scold Mr. Brooke with the friendliest frankness, and let him know in confidence that she thought him a poor creature. (24) From the first arrival of the young ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir James, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was her doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it, caused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with. (25) She was the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen in spite of her was an offensive irregularity. (26) As to freaks like this of Miss Brooke’s, Mrs. Cadwallader had no patience with them, and now saw that her opinion of this girl had been infected with some of her husband’s weak charitableness: those Methodistical whims, that air of being more religious than the rector and curate together, came from a deeper and more constitutional disease than she had been willing to believe. (27) “However,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to her husband, “I throw her over: there was a chance, if she had married Sir James, of her becoming a sane, sensible woman. (28) He would never have contradicted her, and when a woman is not contradicted, she has no motive for obstinacy in her absurdities. (29) But now I wish her joy of her hair shirt.”

It followed that Mrs. Cadwallader must decide on another match for Sir James, and having made up her mind that it was to be the younger Miss Brooke, there could not have been a more skilful move towards the success of her plan than her hint to the baronet that he had made an impression on Celia’s heart. (30) For he was not one of those gentlemen who languish after the unattainable Sappho’s apple that laughs from the topmost bough—the charms which



“Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff,Not to be come at by the willing hand.”



He had no sonnets to write, and it could not strike him agreeably that he was not an object of preference to the woman whom he had preferred.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Emma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have his hair cut. (2) A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut. (3) There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. (4) It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. (5) Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. (6) His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that “all young people would have their little whims.”





With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. (7) Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. (8) He appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect. (9) This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance. (10) Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight. (11) He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. (12) As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their little whims.”





There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. (13) In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr. (14) Knightley. (15) The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! (16) just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an instant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass. (17) Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune. (18) Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave. (19) This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel. (20) On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Their affection was always to subside into friendship. (2) Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. (3) When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings. (4) “I do not find myself making any use of the wordsacrifice,” said she. (5) “In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. (6) I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness. (7) So much the better. (8) I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do. (9) I am quite enough in love. (10) I should be sorry to be more.”

Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings. (11) “Heis undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much in love indeed! (12) and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it. (13) It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. (14) Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. (15) No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched. (16) Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at parting would have been different. (17) Still, however, I must be on my guard. (18) This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy. (19) His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable. (20) Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved. (21) I shall do very well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily.”



When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength. (22) It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. (23) No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety. (24) The charm of her own name was not wanting.MissWoodhouseappeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed. (25) Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss Woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. (26) Pray make my excuses and adieus to her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. (27) Harriet was remembered only from beingherfriend. (28) His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again. (29) Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. (30) Her intentions were unchanged. (31) Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness. (32) His recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the idea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. (33) Was it impossible? (34) No. (35) Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour. (36) For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed. (37) “I must not dwell upon it,” said she. (38) “I must not think of it. (39) I know the danger of indulging such speculations. (40) But stranger things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”



It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. (41) As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill’s disappearance, Mr. Elton’s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form. (42) His wedding-day was named. (43) He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”



“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”



“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. (2) He has a verysatirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”



“The entreaties of several” [Copyright 1894 by George Allen.] (3) On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,—



“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?”



“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.”



“You are severe on us.”



“It will beherturn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. (4) “I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”



“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! (5) always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! (6) If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”



Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. (7) After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. (8) Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. (9) Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. (10) Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:—



“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! (11) There is nothing like dancing, after all. (12) I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.”



“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”



Sir William only smiled. (13) “Your friend performs delightfully,” he continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”



“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”



“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. (14) Do you often dance at St. James’s?”

“Never, sir.”



“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”



“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”



“You have a house in town, I conclude?”



Mr. Darcy bowed. (15) “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”



He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with thenotion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,—



“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? (16) Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. (17) You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,—



“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. (18) I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”



Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. (19) Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. (20) “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.”



“Mr. (21) Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling. (22) “He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?”



Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. (23) Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,—



“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”



“I should imagine not.”



“You are considering how insupportable it would beto pass many evenings in this manner,—in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of your opinion. (24) I was never more annoyed! (25) The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people! (26) What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”



“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. (27) My mind was more agreeably engaged. (28) I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”



Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. (29) Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,—

“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”



“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. (30) “I am all astonishment. (31) How long has she been such a favourite?

Book Title: ARGUMENT.[40]

Book Author: THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.

Paragraph: (1) ARGUMENT. (2) THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES. (3) Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. (4) The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem. (5) He first communicates his design to the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. (6) Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships. (7) They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. (8) The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. (9) This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. (10) The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it removes to Troy. (11) Now pleasing sleep had seal’d each mortal eye,Stretch’d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:The immortals slumber’d on their thrones above;All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove. (12) [76]To honour Thetis’ son he bends his care,And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,And thus commands the vision of the night. (13) “Fly hence, deluding Dream! (14) and light as air,[77]To Agamemnon’s ample tent repair.Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.Declare, e’en now ’tis given him to destroyThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.For now no more the gods with fate contend,At Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wall,And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.”



Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,Descends, and hovers o’er Atrides’ head;Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,Renown’d for wisdom, and revered for age:Around his temples spreads his golden wing,And thus the flattering dream deceives the king. (15) JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON

“Canst thou, with all a monarch’s cares oppress’d,O Atreus’ son! (16) canst thou indulge thy rest? (17) [78]Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,Directs in council, and in war presides,To whom its safety a whole people owes,To waste long nights in indolent repose. (18) [79]Monarch, awake! (19) ’tis Jove’s command I bear;Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.In just array draw forth the embattled train,Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;E’en now, O king! (20) ’tis given thee to destroyThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.For now no more the gods with fate contend,At Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wall,And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.Awake, but waking this advice approve,And trust the vision that descends from Jove.”



The phantom said; then vanish’d from his sight,Resolves to air, and mixes with the night.A thousand schemes the monarch’s mind employ;Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:Vain as he was, and to the future blind,Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design’d,What mighty toils to either host remain,What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!Eager he rises, and in fancy hearsThe voice celestial murmuring in his ears.First on his limbs a slender vest he drew,Around him next the regal mantle threw,The embroider’d sandals on his feet were tied;The starry falchion glitter’d at his side;And last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,Unstain’d, immortal, and the gift of gods. (21) Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,Lifts up her light, and opens day above.The king despatch’d his heralds with commandsTo range the camp and summon all the bands:The gathering hosts the monarch’s word obey;While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;There calls a senate of the peers around:The assembly placed, the king of men express’dThe counsels labouring in his artful breast. (22) “Friends and confederates! (23) with attentive earReceive my words, and credit what you hear.Late as I slumber’d in the shades of night,A dream divine appear’d before my sight;Whose visionary form like Nestor came,The same in habit, and in mien the same. (24) [80]The heavenly phantom hover’d o’er my head,‘And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus’ son? (25) (he said)Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,Directs in council, and in war presides;To whom its safety a whole people owes,To waste long nights in indolent repose.Monarch, awake! (26) ’tis Jove’s command I bear,Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.In just array draw forth the embattled train,And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;E’en now, O king!

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) They numbered scarce eight summers when a nameRose on their souls and stirred such motions thereAs thrill the buds and shape their hidden frameAt penetration of the quickening air:His name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,Making the little world their childhood knewLarge with a land of mountain lake and scaur,And larger yet with wonder, love, beliefToward Walter Scott who living far awaySent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.The book and they must part, but day by day,In lines that thwart like portly spiders ranThey wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan. (2) The evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had begun to see that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must sometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set out at five o’clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself that she accepted their new relations willingly. (3) He found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great apple-tree in the orchard. (4) It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her eldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a short holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the world to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate Porson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of object-lesson given to him by the educational mother. (5) Christy himself, a square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not much higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he should be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought no more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s, wishing that he himself were more of the same height. (6) He was lying on the ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over his eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young lives. (7) The volume was “Ivanhoe,” and Jim was in the great archery scene at the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who had fetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself dreadfully disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to observe his random shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the active-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled Newfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality of extreme old age. (8) Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and pinafore some slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering of the cherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated on the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading. (9) But the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred Vincy. (10) When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on his way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and snatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s outstretched leg, and said “Take me!”



“Oh, and me too,” said Letty. (11) “You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben. (12) “Yes, I can. (13) Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose life was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl. (14) “I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up to her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the other. (15) “Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms. (16) “No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. (17) And that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. (18) Besides, your father will come home. (19) We must let Fred go alone. (20) He can tell Mary that you are here, and she will come back to-morrow.”



Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s beautiful white trousers. (21) Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the advantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of looking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Mr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella’s first day. (2) Emma’s sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation. (3) She hoped they might now become friends again. (4) She thought it was time to make up. (5) Making-up indeed would not do.Shecertainly had not been in the wrong, andhewould never own that he had. (6) Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her aunt’s arms. (7) It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. (8) Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,



“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces. (9) As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.”



“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.”



“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.”



“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. (10) I was sixteen years old when you were born.”

“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?”



“Yes—a good dealnearer.”



“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently.”



“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. (11) Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. (12) Tell your aunt, little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”



“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. (13) Little Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt. (14) Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited. (15) Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. (16) As far as good intentions went, we werebothright, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. (17) I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”



“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer. (18) “Ah! (19) Indeed I am very sorry. (20) Come, shake hands with me.”

This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley made his appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John, how are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other. (21) The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other. (22) The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker. (23) As a magistrate, he had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party. (2) How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also. (3) Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing. (4) The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. (5) Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls. (6) She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears. (7) Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. (8) She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. (9) They joined company and proceeded together. (10) Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s complaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,



“A sore-throat! (11) I hope not infectious. (12) I hope not of a putrid infectious sort. (13) Has Perry seen her? (14) Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. (15) Let me entreat you to run no risks. (16) Why does not Perry see her?”

Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,



“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. (17) But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. (18) You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”



Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly very cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening. (19) “You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.”



But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. (20) It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her. (21) “Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange! (22) After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind! (23) Most strange indeed! (24) But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked. (25) What a strange thing love is! (26) he can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”



Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour. (27) After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with—



“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton. (28) It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. (29) With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature works.”



“Mr. (30) Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. (31) Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority. (32) There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.”



“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.”



“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton’s object?”



“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.”



“Mr. (33) Elton in love with me! (34) What an idea!”

“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. (35) I think your manners to him encouraging.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) I had indeed gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took off of the feet of the two drownedmen whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the chests which were very welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. (2) I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold. (3) I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. (4) Well, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I brought from our own ship; but it was great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over with money, which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it. (5) Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbor, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. (6) So I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came and where I could go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the other way. (7) I lived in this condition near two years more; but my unluckyhead, that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all this two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from this island; for sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. (8) I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know one-half of their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and Nature has placed them; for now to look back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, myoriginal sin, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been, by this time, I mean in the time of my being in this island, one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded that by the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had stayed, I might have been worth an hundred thousand moidores. (9) And what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargoto Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose business it was to fetch them; and though it had cost us something more, yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard. (10) But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of time; and so it was with me now. (11) And yet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this place. (12) And that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation, I acted. (13) I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my condition restored to what it was before. (14) I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there. (15) It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four and twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitariness. (16) I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake, very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary,but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows. (17) It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night’s time. (18) I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of the part of my life since I came to this island. (19) In my reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I had lived ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore there; but I had never know it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it. (20) My satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had never really been exposed to it. (21) This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: how infinitely good that Providence is which has provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. (22) After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night had been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I did of a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. (23) I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility, that all these unknown deliverances were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands. (24) When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all things should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity; nay, to something so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind. (25) But as this ended in some (at that time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in? (26) how far off the coast was from whence they came? (27) what they ventured over so far from home for? (28) what kind of boats they had? (29) and why I might not order myself and my business so, that I might be as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me. (30) I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with myself when I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted by some or other of them, without any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, what I should do for provision; or whither I should bend my course.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) R. COLLINS was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance. (2) The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. (3) A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. (4) Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as hemeant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. (5) This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. (6) His plan did not vary on seeing them. (7) Miss Bennet’s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first eveningshewas his settled choice. (8) The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’stête-à-têtewith Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. (9) “As to heryoungerdaughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did notknowof any prepossession;—hereldestdaughter she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”



Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. (10) Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. (11) Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces. (12) Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. (13) Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. (14) In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go. (15) In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. (16) The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained byhim. (17) Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them. (18) But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. (19) The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. (20) All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possibleto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. (21) Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps. (22) This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. (23) His appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. (24) The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. (25) On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. (2) But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents—talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. (3) When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. (4) Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother andsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. (5) Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. (6) It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. (7) Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. (8) “But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for. (9) Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. (10) But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. (11) A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”



When Lydia went away she promised to write veryoften and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. (12) Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public. (13) After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. (14) Everything wore a happier aspect. (15) The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. (16) Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears,—an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. (17) The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. (18) Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July,and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. (19) In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. (20) The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak. (21) Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. (22) But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again. (23) With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. (24) It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. (25) “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”



The period of expectation was now doubled. (26) Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. (27) But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. (28) The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetnessof temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them. (29) The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. (2) They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. (3) Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. (4) They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. (5) There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. (6) Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. (7) They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market townwhere the family did not visit. (8) It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor. (9) With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged. (10) As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towardsonein that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. (11) She certainly did not hate him. (12) No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. (13) The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. (14) But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked. (15) It was gratitude;—gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. (16) He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidentalmeeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. (17) Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. (18) She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses. (19) It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley—for she had reached it only to a late breakfast—ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. (20) They were, therefore, to go. (21) Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply. (22) Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. (23) The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.

Book Title: Middlemarch

Book Author: George Eliot

Paragraph: (1) Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not interested himself. (2) “I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking to Will. (3) “Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. (4) “He will tell you, it is allpfuscherei, which is his most opprobrious word!”



“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who made a slight grimace and said—



“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. (5) His walk must bebelles-lettres. (6) That is wi-ide.”

Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word satirically. (7) Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr. Casaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent, began to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity. (8) The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr. Casaubon, came forward again and said—



“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas Aquinas in my picture there. (9) It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see just what I want—the idealistic in the real.”



“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved with a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel honored. (10) That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one; and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”



As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and worthiest among the sons of men. (11) In that case her tottering faith would have become firm again. (12) Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. (13) Dorothea sat down and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a long while before. (14) Every one about her seemed good, and she said to herself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been full of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. (15) No nature could be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows, and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made manifest. (16) The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched himself on some steps in the background overlooking all. (17) Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”



Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—



“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I could not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”



“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. (18) “We have nothing to do to-day except go about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon. (19) “It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”



“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with polite condescension. (20) “Having given up the interior of my head to idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”



“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he were considering that. (21) Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—



“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single study.”



Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him, and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”



Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that stool, please, so!”



Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he was adjusting her arm. (22) All this was impudence and desecration, and he repented that he had brought her. (23) The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear from his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. (24) Naumann took the hint and said—

“Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”



So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. (25) On the morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. (26) The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented, but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. (27) The Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement was conditional. (28) I will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will joined, but with a difference. (29) No sooner did Naumann mention any detail of Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption: there was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words, and what business had he to talk of her lips? (30) She was not a woman to be spoken of as other women were.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself. (2) But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed;and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving home. (3) Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. (4) Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. (5) She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. (6) In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. (7) She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal. (8) On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former. (9) He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. (10) Her answer was warmly inhis favour. (11) With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you say that he was at Rosings?”



“Nearly three weeks.”



“And you saw him frequently?”



“Yes, almost every day.”



“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”



“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”



“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. (12) “And pray may I ask—” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? (13) Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style? (14) for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”



“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. (15) “In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.”



While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. (16) There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,—



“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”



Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,—



“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even theappearanceof what is right. (17) His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. (18) I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. (19) His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”



Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. (20) She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. (21) The rest of the evening passed with theappearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. (22) When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. (23) The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. (24) Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. (25) Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,—advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

Book Title: Emma

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away. (2) Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! (3) And I think she feels it. (4) I am sure she does. (5) She is very timid and silent. (6) One can see that she feels the want of encouragement. (7) I like her the better for it. (8) I must confess it is a recommendation to me. (9) I am a great advocate for timidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it. (10) But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. (11) Oh! (12) I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express.”



“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—



“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. (13) You and I need not be afraid. (14) Ifweset the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations.Wehave carriages to fetch and convey her home, andwelive in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient. (15) I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having askedmorethan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. (16) I have no idea of that sort of thing. (17) It is not likely that Ishould, considering what I have been used to. (18) My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. (19) Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income. (20) However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax. (21) I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. (22) My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly. (23) I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us. (24) I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating. (25) I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”



“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma. (26) “You have not deserved this. (27) You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited! (28) The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton! (29) ‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! (30) Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me! (31) But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”



Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively addressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss Woodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards appeared, and she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done. (32) She looked on with some amusement. (33) Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs. Elton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth. (34) She was quite one of her worthies—the most amiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. (35) Emma’s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. (36) She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! (37) This was astonishing! (38) She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer. (39) “She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she. (40) “To chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every sort! (41) And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.”



Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there. (42) According to Miss Bates—it all came from her—Mrs. (43) Dixon had written most pressingly.

Book Title: ARGUMENT.[40]

Book Author: THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.

Paragraph: (1) ARGUMENT. (2) [40]

THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON. (3) In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and Briseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. (4) Chryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. (5) The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. (6) Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseïs. (7) The king, being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on Briseïs in revenge. (8) Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. (9) Jupiter, granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for Jupiter’s stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her petition. (10) The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus. (11) Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful springOf woes unnumber’d, heavenly goddess, sing!That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reignThe souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore. (12) [41]Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove! (13) [42]

Declare, O Muse! (14) in what ill-fated hour[43]Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended powerLatona’s son a dire contagion spread,[44]And heap’d the camp with mountains of the dead;The king of men his reverent priest defied,[45]And for the king’s offence the people died. (15) For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gainHis captive daughter from the victor’s chain.Suppliant the venerable father stands;Apollo’s awful ensigns grace his hands:By these he begs; and lowly bending down,Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.He sued to all, but chief implored for graceThe brother-kings, of Atreus’ royal race[46]



“Ye kings and warriors! (16) may your vows be crown’d,And Troy’s proud walls lie level with the ground.May Jove restore you when your toils are o’erSafe to the pleasures of your native shore.But, oh! (17) relieve a wretched parent’s pain,And give Chryseïs to these arms again;If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,And dread avenging Phœbus, son of Jove.”



The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,The priest to reverence, and release the fair.Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:“Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:



Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,In daily labours of the loom employ’d,Or doom’d to deck the bed she once enjoy’d.Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,Far from her native soil and weeping sire.”



HOMER INVOKING THE MUSE



The trembling priest along the shore return’d,And in the anguish of a father mourn’d.Disconsolate, not daring to complain,Silent he wander’d by the sounding main;Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,The god who darts around the world his rays. (18) “O Smintheus! (19) sprung from fair Latona’s line,[47]Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,[48]Thou source of light! (20) whom Tenedos adores,And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa’s shores.If e’er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,[49]Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;God of the silver bow! (21) thy shafts employ,Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy.”



Thus Chryses pray’d:—the favouring power attends,And from Olympus’ lofty tops descends.Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;[50]Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,And gloomy darkness roll’d about his head.The fleet in view, he twang’d his deadly bow,And hissing fly the feather’d fates below.On mules and dogs the infection first began;[51]And last, the vengeful arrows fix’d in man.For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.But ere the tenth revolving day was run,Inspired by Juno, Thetis’ godlike sonConvened to council all the Grecian train;For much the goddess mourn’d her heroes slain. (22) [52]The assembly seated, rising o’er the rest,Achilles thus the king of men address’d:



“Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,And measure back the seas we cross’d before?The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,’Tis time to save the few remains of war.But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,Explore the cause of great Apollo’s rage;Or learn the wasteful vengeance to removeBy mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove. (23) [53]If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,And Phœbus dart his burning shafts no more.”



He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,The past, the present, and the future knew:Uprising slow, the venerable sageThus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:



“Beloved of Jove, Achilles! (24) would’st thou knowWhy angry Phœbus bends his fatal bow?First give thy faith, and plight a prince’s wordOf sure protection, by thy power and sword:For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,Instruct a monarch where his error lies;For though we deem the short-lived fury past,’Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.”To whom Pelides:—“From thy inmost soulSpeak what thou know’st, and speak without control.E’en by that god I swear who rules the day,To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.And whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;Not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are led,The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.”



Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:“Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,Apollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.Nor will the god’s awaken’d fury cease,But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,Till the great king, without a ransom paid,To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.

Book Title: Pride and Prejudice

Book Author: Jane Austen

Paragraph: (1) On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. (2) Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. (3) He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. (4) Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. (5) Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. (6) Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. (7) What could be the meaning of it?It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know. (8) In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend. (9) Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation. (10) Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield, because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. (11) She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. (12) Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’scommission in the ——shire. (13) She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,—and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. (14) This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. (15) The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. (16) Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless. (17) As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. (18) Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips’s manners and politeness. (19) He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. (20) Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) and what notice had I taken of it? (2) Had I done my part? (3) God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him; that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance? (4) This touched my heart very much; and immediately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness. (5) July 4. (6) In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and every night, not tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. (7) It was not long after I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. (8) The impression of my dream revived, and the words, “All these things have not brought thee to repentance” ran seriously in my thought. (9) I was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words, “He is exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance, and to give remission.” I threw down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, “Jesus, Thou son of David! (10) Jesus, Thou exalted Prince and Savior, give me repentance!”



This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayedwith a sense of my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope founded on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. (11) Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, “Call on Me, and I will deliver you,” in a different sense from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything being called deliverance but my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the world. (12) But now I learned to take it in another sense; now I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. (13) As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison to this. (14) And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from affliction. (15) But leaving this part, I return to my journal. (16) My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of. (17) Also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred myselfto furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I could. (18) From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced. (19) The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one to practise, by this experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time. (20) I learnt from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in the dry season was always most accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October. (21) I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place. (22) Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of. (23) It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey of the island itself. (24) I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. (25) I found, after I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived. (26) On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk. (27) There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of, or understanding about, and might perhaps have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. (28) I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. (29) I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand them. (30) I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.

Book Title: Robinson Crusoe

Book Author: Daniel Defoe

Paragraph: (1) he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should offer to touch anything I had; then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even so much as my three earthen jars. (2) As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship’s use, and asked me what I would have for it? (3) I told him he had been so generous to me in everything, that I could not offer to make any price for the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. (4) He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy, Xury, which I was loth to take; not that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. (5) However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligationto set him free in ten years if he turned Christian. (6) Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him. (7) We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days after. (8) And now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was now to consider. (9) The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remember. (10) He would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax—for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. (11) I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house of a good honest man like himself, who had aningeinoas they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the manner of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settle there, I would turn planter among them, resolving in the meantime to find out some way to get my money which I left in London remitted to me. (12) To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization,I purchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England. (13) I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. (14) I call him my neighbor, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. (15) My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years. (16) However, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come. (17) But we both wanted help; and now I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. (18) But alas! (19) for me to do wrong that never did right was no great wonder. (20) I had no remedy but to go on. (21) I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I had done.
