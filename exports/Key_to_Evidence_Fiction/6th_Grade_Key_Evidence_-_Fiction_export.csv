Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) I wish my legs were longer!”



Poor Peggy! (2) I was very sorry for her, and I could not comfort her, for I knew how hard it was upon slow-paced horses to be put with fast ones; all the whipping comes to their share, and they can't help it. (3) She was often used in the phaeton, and was very much liked by some of the ladies, because she was so gentle; and some time after this she was sold to two ladies who drove themselves, and wanted a safe, good horse. (4) I met her several times out in the country, going a good steady pace, and looking as gay and contented as a horse could be. (5) I was very glad to see her, for she deserved a good place. (6) After she left us another horse came in her stead. (7) He was young, and had a bad name for shying and starting, by which he had lost a good place. (8) I asked him what made him shy. (9) “Well, I hardly know,” he said. (10) “I was timid when I was young, and was a good deal frightened several times, and if I saw anything strange I used to turn and look at it—you see, with our blinkers one can't see or understand what a thing is unless one looks round—and then my master always gave me a whipping, which of course made me start on, and did not make me less afraid. (11) I think if he would have let me just look at things quietly, and see that there was nothing to hurt me, it would have been all right, and I should have got used to them. (12) One day an old gentleman was riding with him, and a large piece of white paper or rag blew across just on one side of me. (13) I shied and started forward. (14) My master as usual whipped me smartly, but the old man cried out, 'You're wrong! (15) you're wrong! (16) You should never whip a horse for shying; he shies because he is frightened, and you only frighten him more and make the habit worse.' (17) So I suppose all men don't do so. (18) I am sure I don't want to shy for the sake of it; but how should one know what is dangerous and what is not, if one is never allowed to get used to anything? (19) I am never afraid of what I know. (20) Now I was brought up in a park where there were deer; of course I knew them as well as I did a sheep or a cow, but they are not common, and I know many sensible horses who are frightened at them, and who kick up quite a shindy before they will pass a paddock where there are deer.”



I knew what my companion said was true, and I wished that every young horse had as good masters as Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon. (21) Of course we sometimes came in for good driving here. (22) I remember one morning I was put into the light gig, and taken to a house in Pulteney Street. (23) Two gentlemen came out; the taller of them came round to my head; he looked at the bit and bridle, and just shifted the collar with his hand, to see if it fitted comfortably. (24) “Do you consider this horse wants a curb?” he said to the hostler. (25) “Well,” said the man, “I should say he would go just as well without; he has an uncommon good mouth, and though he has a fine spirit he has no vice; but we generally find people like the curb.”



“I don't like it,” said the gentleman; “be so good as to take it off, and put the rein in at the cheek. (26) An easy mouth is a great thing on a long journey, is it not, old fellow?” he said, patting my neck. (27) Then he took the reins, and they both got up.

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) I suppose so. (2) I don’t know.”

But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again. (3) Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. (4) When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. (5) He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. (6) The look and the action had occupied but an instant. (7) “You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge. (8) “What did you say?”

“Here is a visitor.”



The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work. (9) “Come!” said Defarge. (10) “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one. (11) Show him that shoe you are working at. (12) Take it, monsieur.”

Mr. Lorry took it in his hand. (13) “Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”



There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:



“I forget what it was you asked me. (14) What did you say?”

“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s information?”



“It is a lady’s shoe. (15) It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. (16) It is in the present mode. (17) I never saw the mode. (18) I have had a pattern in my hand.” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride. (19) “And the maker’s name?” said Defarge. (20) Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. (21) The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man. (22) “Did you ask me for my name?”

“Assuredly I did.”



“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”





“Is that all?”



“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”





With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken. (23) “You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him. (24) His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground. (25) “I am not a shoemaker by trade? (26) No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. (27) I-I learnt it here. (28) I taught myself.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin. (2) But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his rudeness. (3) “What are we waiting for now?” asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and Vronsky. (4) “For Snetkov. (5) He has to refuse or to consent to stand,” answered Sviazhsky. (6) “Well, and what has he done, consented or not?”

“That’s the point, that he’s done neither,” said Vronsky. (7) “And if he refuses, who will stand then?” asked Levin, looking at Vronsky. (8) “Whoever chooses to,” said Sviazhsky. (9) “Shall you?” asked Levin. (10) “Certainly not I,” said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside Sergey Ivanovitch. (11) “Who then? (12) Nevyedovsky?” said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot into it. (13) But this was worse still. (14) Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two candidates. (15) “I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,” answered the malignant gentleman. (16) This was Nevyedovsky himself. (17) Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin. (18) “Well, you find it exciting too?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at Vronsky. (19) “It’s something like a race. (20) One might bet on it.”

“Yes, it is keenly exciting,” said Vronsky. (21) “And once taking the thing up, one’s eager to see it through. (22) It’s a fight!” he said, scowling and setting his powerful jaws. (23) “What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! (24) Sees it all so clearly.”

“Oh, yes!” Vronsky assented indifferently. (25) A silence followed, during which Vronsky—since he had to look at something—looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to say something:



“How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice of the peace? (26) You are not in the uniform of one.”

“It’s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution,” Levin answered gloomily. (27) He had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting. (28) “I don’t think so, quite the contrary,” Vronsky said, with quiet surprise.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) ""Take it and put it in the cupboard, for you will need it some day."". (2) Heidi obeyed, and danced around the hut in her delight to see all the beloved thingsagain. (3) Running up to the loft, she exclaimed in great disappointment: ""Oh grandfather, my bed is gone."". (4) ""It will come again,"" the grandfather called up from below; ""how could I know that you were coming back? (5) Get your milk now!"". (6) Heidi, coming down, took her old seat. (7) She seized her bowl and emptied it eagerly, as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted. (8) ""Grandfather, our milk is the best in all the world."". (9) Suddenly Heidi, hearing a shrill whistle, rushed outside, as Peter and all his goats came racing down. (10) Heidi greeted the boy, who stopped, rooted to the spot, staring at her. (11) Then she ran into the midst of her beloved friends, who had not forgotten her either. (12) Schwänli and Bärli bleated for joy, and all her other favorites pressed near to her. (13) Heidi was beside herself with joy, and caressed little Snowhopper and patted Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among them. (14) ""Peter, why don't you come down and say good-night to me?"". (15) Heidi called to the boy. (16) ""Have you come again?"". (17) he exclaimed at last. (18) Then he took Heidi's proffered hand and asked her, as if she had been always there: ""Are you coming up with me to-morrow?"". (19) ""No, to-morrow I must go to grandmother, but perhaps the day after."". (20) Peter had a hard time with his goats that day, for they would not follow him. (21) Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she entered the shed with Bärli and Schwänli and shut the door. (22) When Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant bed waiting for her; and she slept better that night than she had for many, many months, for her great and burning longing had been satisfied. (23) About ten times that night the grandfather rose from his couch to listen to Heidi's quiet breathing. (24) The window was filled up with hay, for from now on the moon was not allowed to shine on Heidi any more. (25) But Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming mountains and had heard the fir-trees roar.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) Cold shivers ran down Peter's back. (2) ""Yes, you'll have to go there, and when they find out that you can't read or even spell, they'll laugh at you!"". (3) ""I'll do it,"" said Peter, half angry and half frightened. (4) ""Oh, I am glad. (5) Let us start right away!"". (6) said Heidi joyfully, pulling Peter over to the table. (7) Among the things that Clara had sent, Heidi had found a little book with the A,B,C and some rhymes. (8) She had chosen this for the lessons. (9) Peter, having to spell the first rhyme, found great difficulty, so Heidi said, ""I'll read it to you, and then you'll be able to do it better. (10) Listen:

""I won't go,"" said Peter stubbornly. (11) ""Where?"". (12) ""Before the court."". (13) ""Hurry up and learn the three letters, then you won't have to!"". (14) Peter, beginning again, repeated the three letters till Heidi said:



""Now you know them."". (15) Having observed the good result of the first rhyme, she began to read again:



Heidi, stopping, looked at Peter, who was so frightened by all these threats and mysterious horrors that he sat as still as a mouse. (16) Heidi's tender heart was touched, and she said comfortingly: ""Don't be afraid, Peter; if you come to me every day, you'll soon learn all the letters and then those thingswon't happen. (17) But come every day, even when it snows. (18) Promise!"". (19) Peter did so, and departed. (20) Obeying Heidi's instructions, he came daily to her for his lesson. (21) Sometimes the grandfather would sit in the room, smoking his pipe; often the corners of his mouth would twitch as if he could hardly keep from laughing. (22) He generally invited Peter to stay to supper afterwards, which liberally rewarded the boy for all his great exertions. (23) Thus the days passed by. (24) In all this time Peter had really made some progress, though the rhymes still gave him difficulty. (25) When they had come to U, Heidi read:

and further,



Often Peter would growl and object to those measures, but nevertheless he kept on learning, and soon had but three letters left. (26) The next few days the following rhymes, with their threats, made Peter more eager than ever. (27) When Heidi read the last,

Peter sneered: ""Nobody even knows where they are! (28) "".

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) All is lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. (2) “What is to be told to Ladybird? (3) He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”

Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor’s room. (4) The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. (5) “Doctor Manette. (6) My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”

The Doctor looked at him for a moment—half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to—and bent over his work again. (7) He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. (8) He worked hard—impatiently—as if in some sense of having been interrupted. (9) Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. (10) He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was. (11) “A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. (12) “It ought to have been finished long ago. (13) Let it be.”

“But, Doctor Manette. (14) Look at me!”

He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work. (15) “You know me, my dear friend? (16) Think again. (17) This is not your proper occupation. (18) Think, dear friend!”

Nothing would induce him to speak more. (19) He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. (20) He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. (21) The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. (22) In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity—as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind. (23) Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. (24) In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. (25) In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post. (26) These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. (27) If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor’s case. (28) In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused to be shaken off. (2) “If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who loves his home and his wife, why is itheis so cold to me?... (3) not cold exactly, he loves me, I know that! (4) But something new is drawing us apart now. (5) Why wasn’t he here all the evening? (6) He told Stiva to say he could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play. (7) Is Yashvin a child? (8) But supposing it’s true. (9) He never tells a lie. (10) But there’s something else in it if it’s true. (11) He is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that. (12) But why prove that to me? (13) He wants to show me that his love for me is not to interfere with his freedom. (14) But I need no proofs, I need love. (15) He ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in Moscow. (16) Is this life? (17) I am not living, but waiting for an event, which is continually put off and put off. (18) No answer again! (19) And Stiva says he cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch. (20) And I can’t write again. (21) I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements for myself—the English family, writing, reading—but it’s all nothing but a sham, it’s all the same as morphine. (22) He ought to feel for me,” she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her eyes. (23) She heard Vronsky’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears—not only dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting composure. (24) She wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had not come home as he had promised—displeased only, and not on any account to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity. (25) She might pity herself, but he must not pity her. (26) She did not want strife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism. (27) “Well, you’ve not been dull?” he said, eagerly and good-humoredly, going up to her.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with excitement. (2) He could hardly contain himself. (3) He felt that he had the greatest news to tell since Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks of Buster Bear in the Green Forest. (4) He couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to. (5) So he hurried to the Smiling Pool, where he was sure he would find Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, and he hoped that perhaps some of the little people who live in the Green Forest might be there too. (6) Sure enough, Peter Rabbit was there on one side of the SmilingPool, making faces at Reddy Fox, who was on the other side, which, of course, was not at all nice of Peter. (7) Mr. and Mrs. Redwing were there, and Blacky the Crow was sitting in the Big Hickory-tree. (8) Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big Rock and climbed up to the very highest part. (9) He looked so excited, and his eyes sparkled so, that every one knew right away that something had happened. (10) ""Hi!"". (11) cried Billy Mink. (12) ""Look at Little Joe Otter! (13) It must be that for once he has been smarter than Buster Bear."". (14) Little Joe made a good-natured face at Billy Mink and shook his head. (15) ""No, Billy,"" said he, ""you are wrong, altogether wrong. (16) I don't believe anybody can be smarter than Buster Bear."". (17) Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter.Page 45. (18) Reddy Fox rolled his lips back in an unpleasant grin. (19) ""Don't be too sure of that!"". (20) he snapped.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) Heidi looked imploringly at her kind protector, and Mr. Sesemann, seeing how much she treasured it, gave it back to her. (2) The happy child at parting thanked him for all his goodness. (3) She also sent a message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she suspected to be the real cause of her going. (4) While Heidi was being lifted into the carriage, Mr. Sesemann assured her that Claraand he would never forget her. (5) Sebastian followed with Heidi's basket and a large bag with provisions. (6) Mr. Sesemann called out: ""Happy journey!"". (7) and the carriage rolled away. (8) Only when Heidi was sitting in the train did she become conscious of where she was going. (9) She knew now that she would really see her grandfather and the grandmother again, also Peter and the goats. (10) Her only fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while she was away. (11) The thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls to the grandmother. (12) While she was musing over all these things, she fell asleep. (13) In Basle she was roused by Sebastian, for there they were to spend the night. (14) The next morning they started off again, and it took them many hours before they reached Mayenfeld. (15) When Sebastian stood on the platform of the station, he wished he could have travelled further in the train rather than have to climb a mountain. (16) Thelast part of the trip might be dangerous, for everything seemed half-wild in this country. (17) Looking round, he discovered a small wagon with a lean horse. (18) A broad-shouldered man was just loading up large bags, which had come by the train. (19) Sebastian, approaching the man, asked some information concerning the least dangerous ascent to the Alp. (20) After a while it was settled that the man should take Heidi and her trunk to the village and see to it that somebody would go up with her from there. (21) Not a word had escaped Heidi, until she now said, ""I can go up alone from the village. (22) I know the road."". (23) Sebastian felt relieved, and calling Heidi to him, presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a letter for the grandfather. (24) These precious things were put at the bottom of the basket, under the rolls, so that they could not possibly get lost. (25) Heidi promised to be careful of them, and was lifted up to the cart. (26) The two old friends shook hands and parted, andSebastian, with a slightly bad conscience for having deserted the child so soon, sat down on the station to wait for a returning train. (27) The driver was no other than the village baker, who had never seen Heidi but had heard a great deal about her.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) “Oh dear! (2) Only a week more, and then we must go back. (3) Don't you hate the thoughts of it?” said Jack, as he was giving Jill her early walk on the beach one August morning. (4) “Yes, it will be dreadful to leave Gerty and Mamie and all the nice people. (5) But I'm so much better I won't have to be shut up again, even if I don't go to school. (6) How I long to see Merry and Molly. (7) Dear things, if it wasn't for them I should hate going home more than you do,” answered Jill, stepping along quite briskly, and finding it very hard to resist breaking into a skip or a run, she felt so well and gay. (8) “Wish they could be here to-day to see the fun,” said Jack, for it was the anniversary of the founding of the place, and the people celebrated it by all sorts of festivity. (9) “I did want to ask Molly, but your mother is so good to me I couldn't find courage to do it. (10) Mammy told me not to ask for a thing, and I'm sure I don't get a chance. (11) I feel just as if I was your truly born sister, Jack.”



“That's all right, I'm glad you do,” answered Jack, comfortably, though his mind seemed a little absent and his eyes twinkled when she spoke of Molly. (12) “Now, you sit in the cubby-house, and keep quiet till the boat comes in. (13) Then the fun will begin, and you must be fresh and ready to enjoy it. (14) Don't run off, now, I shall want to know where to find you by and by.”



“No more running off, thank you. (15) I'll stay here till you come, and finish this box for Molly; she has a birthday this week, and I've written to ask what day, so I can send it right up and surprise her.”



Jack's eyes twinkled more than ever as he helped Jill settle herself in the boat, and then with a whoop he tore over the beach, as if practising for the race which was to come off in the afternoon. (16) Jill was so busy with her work that time went quickly, and the early boat came in just as the last pink shell was stuck in its place. (17) Putting the box in the sun to dry, she leaned out of her nook to watch the gay parties land, and go streaming up the pier along the road that went behind the bank that sheltered her. (18) Flocks of children were running about on the sand, and presently strangers appeared, eager to see and enjoy all the delights of this gala-day. (19) “There's a fat little boy who looks ever so much like Boo,” said Jill to herself, watching the people and hoping they would not come and find her, since she had promised to stay till Jack returned. (20) The fat little boy was staring about him in a blissful sort of maze, holding a wooden shovel in one hand and the skirts of a young girl with the other. (21) Her back was turned to Jill, but something in the long brown braid with a fly-away blue bow hanging down her back looked very familiar to Jill. (22) So did the gray suit and the Japanese umbrella; but the hat was strange, and while she was thinking how natural the boots looked, the girl turned round.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) They hardly expected an answer at noon, as the Hill people were not very eager for their mail, but at night Jill was sure of a letter, and to her great delight it came. (2) Jack brought it himself, which added to the fun, and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular “Youth's Companion.”



Bob was not a “complete letter-writer” by any means, and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle. (3) Not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone, and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way:—



“Jack did come up Friday. (4) Sorry he got into a mess. (5) It was real kind of him, and I shall pay him back soon. (6) Jack paid Jerry for me and I made him promise not to tell. (7) Jerry said he'd come here and make a row if I didn't cash up. (8) I was afraid I'd lose the place if he did, for the Capt. (9) is awful strict. (10) If Jack don't tell now, I will. (11) I ain't mean. (12) Glad you wrote. (13) “R.O.W.”

“Hurrah!” cried Jill, waving the letter over her head in great triumph. (14) “Call everybody and read it out,” she added, as Frank snatched it, and ran for his mother, seeing at a glance that the news was good. (15) Jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing “Pretty Bobby Shafto” at the top of her voice, to Jack's great disgust, for he considered the song very personal, as hewasrather fond of “combing down his yellow hair,” and Jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead. (16) In about five minutes the door flew open and in came Mamma, making straight for bewildered Jack, who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms, saying tenderly,—



“My good, generous boy! (17) I knew he was right all the time!” while Frank worked his hand up and down like a pump-handle, exclaiming heartily,—



“You're a trump, sir, and I'm proud of you!” Jill meantime calling out, in wild delight,—



“I told you so! (18) I told you so! (19) I did find out; ha, ha, I did!”

“Come, I say! (20) What's the matter? (21) I'm all right. (22) Don't squeeze the breath out of me, please,” expostulated Jack, looking so startled and innocent, as he struggled feebly, that they all laughed, and this plaintive protest caused him to be released. (23) But the next proceeding did not enlighten him much, for Frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it, while Mamma made a charge at Jill, as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody. (24) “Hullo!” said Jack, when he got the letter into his own hand and read it. (25) “Now who put Bob up to this? (26) Nobody had any business to interfere—but it's mighty good of him, anyway,” he added, as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away, while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word. (27) “I did!” cried Jill, clapping her hands, and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to.

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. (2) Ha, ha, ha! (3) He is so droll, that Samson. (4) Such a Barber!”

“Do you often go to see him—”



“Shave? (5) Always. (6) Every day. (7) What a barber! (8) You have seen him at work?”

“Never.”



“Go and see him when he has a good batch. (9) Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! (10) Less than two pipes. (11) Word of honour!”

As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away. (12) “But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear English dress?”



“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder. (13) “You speak like a Frenchman.”

“I am an old student here.”



“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! (14) Good night, Englishman.”

“Good night, citizen.”



“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after him. (15) “And take a pipe with you!”

Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper. (16) Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets—much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror—he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands. (17) A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man. (18) Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. (19) “Whew!” the chemist whistled softly, as he read it. (20) “Hi! (21) hi! (22) hi!”

Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:



“For you, citizen?”



“For me.”



“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? (23) You know the consequences of mixing them?”

“Perfectly.”



Certain small packets were made and given to him. (24) He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop. (25) “There is nothing more to do,” said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. (26) I can’t sleep.”

It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance. (27) It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) eidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle. (2) Opening her eyes, she saw her little bed and the hay beside her bathed in golden sunlight. (3) For a short while she did not know where she was, but when she heard her grandfather's deep voice outside, she recollected everything. (4) She remembered how she had come up the mountain the day before and left old Ursula, who was always shivering with cold and sat near the stove all day. (5) While Heidi lived with Ursula, she had always been obliged to keep in the house, where the old woman could see her. (6) Being deaf, Ursula was afraid to let Heidi go outdoors, and the child had often fretted in the narrow room and had longed to run outside. (7) She was therefore delighted to find herself in her new home and hardly could waitto see the goats again. (8) Jumping out of bed, she put on her few things and in a short time went down the ladder and ran outside. (9) Peter was already there with his flock, waiting for Schwänli and Bärli, whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats. (10) ""Do you want to go with him to the pasture?"". (11) asked the grandfather. (12) ""Yes,"" cried Heidi, clapping her hands. (13) ""Go now, and wash yourself first, for the sun will laugh at you if he sees how dirty you are. (14) Everything is ready there for you,"" he added, pointing to a large tub of water that stood in the sun. (15) Heidi did as she was told, and washed and rubbed herself till her cheeks were glowing. (16) In the meanwhile the grandfather called to Peter to come into the hut and bring his bag along. (17) The boy followed the old man, who commanded him to open the bag in which he carried his scanty dinner. (18) The grandfather put into the bag a piece of bread and a slice of cheese, that were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the bag himself. (19) ""The little bowl goes in, too,"" said the Uncle, ""for the child does not know how to drink straight from the goat, the way you do. (20) She is going to stay with you all day, therefore milk two bowls full for her dinner. (21) Look out that she does not fall over the rocks! (22) Do you hear?"". (23) Just then Heidi came running in. (24) ""Grandfather, can the sun still laugh at me? (25) "".

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) In the second place, Sammy fairly ached all over to spread the news through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows. (2) You know he is a great gossip. (3) And this was such unusual news. (4) Sammy knew very well that no one would believe him. (5) He knew that they just couldn't believe that smart Mr. Chatterer had really been caught. (6) And no one did believe it. (7) ""All right,"" Sammy would reply. (8) ""It doesn't make the least bit of differencein the world to me whether you believe it or not. (9) You can go up to Farmer Brown's house and see him in prison yourself, just as I did."". (10) So late that afternoon, when all was quiet around the farmyard, Chatterer saw something very familiar behind the old stone wall at the edge of the Old Orchard. (11) It bobbed up and then dropped out of sight again. (12) Then it bobbed up again, only to drop out of sight just as quickly. (13) ""It looks to me very much as if Peter Rabbit is over there and feeling very nervous,"" said Chatterer to himself, and then he called sharply, just as when he was free in the Green Forest. (14) Right away Peter's head bobbed up for all the world like a jack-in-the-box, and this time it stayed up. (15) Peter's eyes were round with surprise, as he stared across at Chatterer's prison. (16) ""Oh, it's true!"". (17) gasped Peter, as if it were as hard work to believe his own eyes as it was to believe Sammy Jay. (18) ""I must go right away and see what can be done to get Chatterer out of trouble."". (19) And then, because it was broad daylight, and he really didn't dare stay another minute, Peter waved good-by to Chatterer and started for the Green Forest as fast as his long legs could take him. (20) A little later who should appear peeping over the stone wall but Reddy Fox. (21) It seemed very bold of Reddy, but really it wasn't nearly as bold as it seemed. (22) You see, Reddy knew that Farmer Brown's boy and Bowser the Hound were over in the Old Pasture, and that he had nothing to fear. (23) He grinned at Chatterer in the most provoking way. (24) It made Chatterer angry just to see him. (25) So said Reddy Fox, knowing all the time that Chatterer couldn't take a walk with any one. (26) At first Chatterer scolded and called Reddy all the bad names he could think of, but after a little he didn't feel so much like scolding. (27) In fact, he didn't half hear the mean things Reddy Fox said to him.

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) ome people never seem to learn that. (2) You would suppose that after all the trouble and worry Chatterer the Red Squirrel had had, he would have learned a lesson. (3) For a while it seemed as if he had. (4) Morning after morning, before anybody was up in Farmer Brown's house, he visited Farmer Brown's corn-crib, taking the greatest care not to be seen and to get back to his home in the Old Orchard before it was time for Farmer Brown'sboy to come out and do his morning's work. (5) And in the corn-crib he took the greatest care to steal only where what he took would not be missed. (6) The empty cobs from which he had eaten the corn he hid in the darkest corner behind the great pile of yellow corn, where they would not be found until nearly all the corn had been taken from the crib. (7) Oh, he was very sly and crafty, was Chatterer the Red Squirrel—at first. (8) But after a while, when nothing happened, Chatterer grew careless. (9) At first it had seemed very dangerous to go over to the corn-crib, but after he had been there often, it didn't seem dangerous at all. (10) Once inside, he would just give himself up to having a good time. (11) He raced about over the great pile of beautiful yellow corn and found the loveliest hiding places in it.Down in a dark corner he made a splendid bed from pieces of husk which hadn't been stripped from some of the ears. (12) It was quite the nicest place he had ever dreamed of, was Farmer Brown's corn-crib. (13) He got to feeling that it was his own and not Farmer Brown's at all. (14) The more that feeling grew, the more careless Chatterer became. (15) He dropped a grain of corn now and then and was too lazy to go down and pick it up, or else didn't think anything about it. (16) Farmer Brown's boy, coming every morning for corn for the hens, noticed these grains, but supposed they were some that had been rubbed from the ears during the handling of them. (17) Then one morning Chatterer dropped a cob from which he had eaten all the corn. (18) He meant to get it and hide it, as he had hidden othercobs, but he didn't want to do it just then. (19) And later—well, then he forgot all about it. (20) Yes, Sir, he forgot all about it until he had reached his home in the Old Orchard. (21) ""Oh, well,"" thought Chatterer, ""it doesn't matter.

Book Title: The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. (2) It’s one’s duty to do so. (3) And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. (4) That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple. (5) ALGERNON.The truth is rarely pure and never simple. (6) Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility! (7) JACK.That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing. (8) ALGERNON.Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. (9) Don’t try it. (10) You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University. (11) They do it so well in the daily papers. (12) What you really are is a Bunburyist. (13) I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. (14) You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know. (15) JACK.What on earth do you mean? (16) ALGERNON.You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. (17) I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. (18) Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. (19) If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week. (20) JACK.I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night. (21) ALGERNON.I know. (22) You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. (23) It is very foolish of you. (24) Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations. (25) JACK.You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta. (26) ALGERNON.I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. (27) To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own relations. (28) In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) verybody knows that Sammy Jay has sharp eyes. (2) In fact, there are very few of the little forest people whose eyes are as sharp as Sammy's. (3) That is because he uses them so much. (4) A long time ago he found out that the more he used his eyes, the sharper they became, and so there are very few minutes when Sammy is awake that he isn't trying to see something. (5) He is always looking. (6) That is the reason he always knows so much about what is going on in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. (7) Now of course Chatterer the RedSquirrel couldn't disappear without being missed, particularly by Sammy Jay. (8) And of course Sammy couldn't miss Chatterer and not wonder what had become of him. (9) At first, Sammy thought that Chatterer was hiding, but after peeking and peering and watching in the Old Orchard for a few days, he was forced to think that either Chatterer had once more moved or else that something had happened to him. (10) ""Perhaps Shadow the Weasel has caught him, after all,"" thought Sammy, and straightway flew to a certain place in the Green Forest where he might find Shadow the Weasel. (11) Sure enough, Shadow was there. (12) Now of course it wouldn't do to ask right out if Shadow had caught Chatterer, and Sammy was smart enough to know it. (13) ""Chatterer the Red Squirrel sends his respects and hopes you are enjoyingyour hunt for him,"" called Sammy. (14) Shadow looked up at Sammy, and anger blazed in his little, red eyes. (15) ""You tell Chatterer that I'll get him yet!"". (16) snarled Shadow. (17) Sammy's eyes sparkled with mischief. (18) He had made Shadow angry, and he had found out what he wanted to know. (19) He was sure that Shadow had not caught Chatterer. (20) ""But what can have become of him?"". (21) thought Sammy.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) In a moment he let down my head. (2) “Confound these check-reins!” he said to himself; “I thought we should have some mischief soon. (3) Master will be sorely vexed. (4) But there, if a woman's husband can't rule her of course a servant can't; so I wash my hands of it, and if she can't get to the duchess' garden party I can't help it.”



York did not say this before the men; he always spoke respectfully when they were by. (5) Now he felt me all over, and soon found the place above my hock where I had been kicked. (6) It was swelled and painful; he ordered it to be sponged with hot water, and then some lotion was put on. (7) Lord W—— was much put out when he learned what had happened; he blamed York for giving way to his mistress, to which he replied that in future he would much prefer to receive his orders only from his lordship; but I think nothing came of it, for things went on the same as before. (8) I thought York might have stood up better for his horses, but perhaps I am no judge. (9) Ginger was never put into the carriage again, but when she was well of her bruises one of the Lord W——'s younger sons said he should like to have her; he was sure she would make a good hunter. (10) As for me, I was obliged still to go in the carriage, and had a fresh partner called Max; he had always been used to the tight rein. (11) I asked him how it was he bore it. (12) “Well,” he said, “I bear it because I must; but it is shortening my life, and it will shorten yours too if you have to stick to it.”



“Do you think,” I said, “that our masters know how bad it is for us?”



“I can't say,” he replied, “but the dealers and the horse-doctors know it very well. (13) I was at a dealer's once, who was training me and another horse to go as a pair; he was getting our heads up, as he said, a little higher and a little higher every day. (14) A gentleman who was there asked him why he did so. (15) 'Because,' said he, 'people won't buy them unless we do. (16) The London people always want their horses to carry their heads high and to step high. (17) Of course it is very bad for the horses, but then it is good for trade. (18) The horses soon wear up, or get diseased, and they come for another pair.' (19) That,” said Max, “is what he said in my hearing, and you can judge for yourself.”



What I suffered with that rein for four long months in my lady's carriage it would be hard to describe; but I am quite sure that, had it lasted much longer, either my health or my temper would have given way. (20) Before that, I never knew what it was to foam at the mouth, but now the action of the sharp bit on my tongue and jaw, and the constrained position of my head and throat, always caused me to froth at the mouth more or less. (21) Some people think it very fine to see this, and say, “What fine spirited creatures!” But it is just as unnatural for horses as for men to foam at the mouth; it is a sure sign of some discomfort, and should be attended to. (22) Besides this, there was a pressure on my windpipe, which often made my breathing very uncomfortable; when I returned from my work my neck and chest were strained and painful, my mouth and tongue tender, and I felt worn and depressed. (23) In my old home I always knew that John and my master were my friends; but here, although in many ways I was well treated, I had no friend. (24) York might have known, and very likely did know, how that rein harassed me; but I suppose he took it as a matter of course that it could not be helped; at any rate, nothing was done to relieve me.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had everything renewed. (2) He is very fond of this place, and, what I never expected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it. (3) But his is such a rich nature! (4) Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly. (5) So far from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest. (6) He—with his temperament as I know it—he has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land. (7) But only in that. (8) When it’s a question of tens of thousands, he doesn’t think of money.” She spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them—of those they love. (9) “Do you see that big building? (10) that’s the new hospital. (11) I believe it will cost over a hundred thousand; that’s his hobby just now. (12) And do you know how it all came about? (13) The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly. (14) Of course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about money.C’est une petitesse, if you like, but I love him all the more for it. (15) And now you’ll see the house in a moment. (16) It was his grandfather’s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.”



“How beautiful!” said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored greens of the old trees in the garden. (17) “Isn’t it fine? (18) And from the house, from the top, the view is wonderful.”



They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers, in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry. (19) “Ah, they’re here already!” said Anna, looking at the saddle horses, which were just being led away from the steps. (20) “It is a nice horse, isn’t it? (21) It’s my cob; my favorite. (22) Lead him here and bring me some sugar. (23) Where is the count?” she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out. (24) “Ah, there he is!” she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet her with Veslovsky. (25) “Where are you going to put the princess?” said Vronsky in French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand. (26) “I think the big balcony room.”

“Oh, no, that’s too far off! (27) Better in the corner room, we shall see each other more. (28) Come, let’s go up,” said Anna, as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) 'Twas just a sudden odd surpriseMade Farmer Brown's boy's hair to rise. (2) That's a funny thing for hair to do—rise up all of a sudden—isn't it? (3) But that is just what the hair on Farmer Brown's boy's head did the day he went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all. (4) There are just two things that make hair rise—anger and fear. (5) Anger sometimes makes the hair on the back and neck of Bowser the Hound and of some other little people bristle and stand up, and you know the hair on the tail of Black Pussy stands onend until her tail looks twice as big as it really is. (6) Both anger and fear make it do that. (7) But there is only one thing that can make the hair on the head of Farmer Brown's boy rise, and as it isn't anger, of course it must be fear. (8) It never had happened before. (9) You see, there isn't much of anything that Farmer Brown's boy is really afraid of. (10) Perhaps he wouldn't have been afraid this time if it hadn't been for the surprise of what he found. (11) You see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one else had been fishing, and that was why he couldn't catch any; but it didn't seem possible that little Billy Mink could have eaten all those trout, and Farmer Brown's boy didn't once think of Little Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled. (12) He was turning it all over in his mindand studying what it could mean, when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the Laughing Brook, and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop right out of his head, and it was right then that he felt his hair rise. (13) Anyway, that is what he said when he told about it afterward. (14) What was it he saw? (15) What do you think? (16) Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud. (17) Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was. (18) But it was the biggest footprint Farmer Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it had been made only a few minutes before. (19) It was the footprint of Buster Bear.

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) But after a while, when nothing happened, Chatterer grew careless. (2) At first it had seemed very dangerous to go over to the corn-crib, but after he had been there often, it didn't seem dangerous at all. (3) Once inside, he would just give himself up to having a good time. (4) He raced about over the great pile of beautiful yellow corn and found the loveliest hiding places in it.Down in a dark corner he made a splendid bed from pieces of husk which hadn't been stripped from some of the ears. (5) It was quite the nicest place he had ever dreamed of, was Farmer Brown's corn-crib. (6) He got to feeling that it was his own and not Farmer Brown's at all. (7) The more that feeling grew, the more careless Chatterer became. (8) He dropped a grain of corn now and then and was too lazy to go down and pick it up, or else didn't think anything about it. (9) Farmer Brown's boy, coming every morning for corn for the hens, noticed these grains, but supposed they were some that had been rubbed from the ears during the handling of them. (10) Then one morning Chatterer dropped a cob from which he had eaten all the corn. (11) He meant to get it and hide it, as he had hidden othercobs, but he didn't want to do it just then. (12) And later—well, then he forgot all about it. (13) Yes, Sir, he forgot all about it until he had reached his home in the Old Orchard. (14) ""Oh, well,"" thought Chatterer, ""it doesn't matter. (15) I can get it and hide it to-morrow morning."". (16) Now a corn-cob is a very simple thing. (17) Farmer Brown's boy knew where there was a whole pile of them. (18) He added to that pile every day, after shelling enough corn for the biddies. (19) So it would seem that there was nothing about a corn-cob to make him open his eyes as he did that morning, when he saw the one left by Chatterer the Red Squirrel. (20) But you see he knew that a bare corn-cob had no business inside the corn-crib, and suddenly those scattered grains of corn had a new meaning for him. (21) ""Ha, ha!"". (22) he exclaimed, ""A thief has been here, after all! (23) I thought we were safe from rats and mice, and I don't see now how they got in, for I don't, I really don't, see how they could climb the stone legs of the corn-crib. (24) But some one with sharp teeth certainly has been in here. (25) It must be that I have left the door open some time, and a rat has slipped in. (26) I'll just have to get after you, Mr. Rat or Mr. (27) Mouse. (28) We can't have you in our corn-crib. (29) "".

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) “So, then! (2) One more pull and you’re at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it! (3) Joe!”

“Halloa!” the guard replied. (4) “What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”

“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”



“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s yet! (5) Tst! (6) Yah! (7) Get on with you!”

The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. (8) Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. (9) They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. (10) If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman. (11) The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. (12) The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in. (13) “Tst! (14) Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box. (15) “What do you say, Tom?”

They both listened. (16) “I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”

“Isay a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. (17) “Gentlemen! (18) In the king’s name, all of you!”

With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive. (19) The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. (20) He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. (21) They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. (22) The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting. (23) The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. (24) The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. (25) The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation. (26) The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. (27) “So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. (28) “Yo there!

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) hatterer had never had so many surprises—good surprises—in all his life, as since the day he had been caught in a trap in Farmer Brown's corn-crib. (2) In the first place, it had been a great surprise to him that he had not been given to Black Pussy, as he had fully expected to be. (3) Then had come the even greater surprise of finding that Farmer Brown's boy was ever and ever so much nicer than he had thought. (4) A later surprise had been the wire wheel in his cage, so that he could run to his heart's content. (5) It was such a pleasant and wholly unexpected surprise that it had quite changed Chatterer'sfeelings towards Farmer Brown's boy. (6) The fact is, Chatterer could have been truly happy but for one thing—he was a prisoner. (7) Yes, Sir, he was a prisoner, and he couldn't forget it for one minute while he was awake. (8) He used to watch Farmer Brown's boy and wish with all his might that he could make him understand how dreadful it was to be in a prison. (9) But Farmer Brown's boy couldn't understand what Chatterer said, no matter how hard Chatterer tried to make him. (10) He seemed to think that Chatterer was happy. (11) He just didn't understand that not all the good things in the world could make up for loss of freedom—that it is better to be free, though hungry and cold, than in a prison with every comfort. (12) Chatterer had stood it pretty well and made the best of things untilSammy Jay had found him, and Reddy Fox had made fun of him, and Peter Rabbit had peeped at him from behind the old stone wall. (13) The very sight of them going where they pleased and when they pleased had been too much for Chatterer, and such a great longing for the Green Forest and the Old Orchard filled his heart that he could think of nothing else. (14) He just sat in a corner of his cage and looked as miserable as he felt. (15) He lost his appetite. (16) In vain Farmer Brown's boy brought him the fattest nuts and other dainties. (17) He couldn't eat for the great longing for freedom that filled his heart until it seemed ready to burst. (18) He no longer cared to run in the new wire wheel which had given him so much pleasure at first. (19) He was homesick, terribly homesick, and he just couldn't help it.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) sighed the grandmother. (2) ""Have you seen whether theytook Heidi away? (3) Oh, if she only could give me her hand once more! (4) Oh, I long to hear her voice once more!"". (5) The same moment the door was flung open and Heidi held her tight. (6) ""Grandmother, just think. (7) My bed with the three pillows and the thick cover is coming from Frankfurt. (8) Grandmama has said that it will be here in two days."". (9) Heidi thought that grandmother would be beside herself with joy, but the old woman, smiling sadly, said:



""Oh, what a good lady she must be! (10) I know I ought to be glad she is taking you with her, Heidi, but I don't think I shall survive it long."". (11) ""But nobody has said so,"" the grandmama, who had overheard those words, said kindly. (12) Pressing the old woman's hand, she continued: ""It is out of the question. (13) Heidi will stay with you and make you happy. (14) To see Heidi again, we will come up every year to the Alm, for we have many reasons to thank the Lord there."". (15) Immediately the face of the grandmother lighted up, and she cried tears of joy. (16) ""Oh, what wonderful things God is doing for me!"". (17) said the grandmother, deeply touched. (18) ""How good people are to trouble themselves about such a poor old woman as I. (19) Nothing in this world strengthens the belief in a good Father in Heaven more than this mercy and kindness shown to a poor, useless little woman, like me."". (20) ""My dear grandmother,"" said Mrs. Sesemann, ""before God in Heaven we are all equally miserable and poor; woe to us, if He should forget us! (21) But now we must say good-bye; next year we shall come to see you just as soon as we come up the Alp. (22) We shall never forget you!"". (23) With that, Mrs. Sesemann shook her hand. (24) It was some time before she was allowed to leave, however, because the grandmother thanked her over and over again, and invoked all Heaven's blessings on her and her house. (25) Mr. Sesemann and his mother went ondown, while Clara was carried up to spend her last night in the hut. (26) Next morning, Clara shed hot tears at parting from the beloved place, where such gladness had been hers. (27) Heidi consoled her with plans for the coming summer, that was to be even more happy than this one had been. (28) Mr. Sesemann then arrived, and a few last parting words were exchanged.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) “Well, you are slow!” the counting-house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road. (2) “Come along, do!”

A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening his steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand. (3) “Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house? (4) the count’s?” he repeated; “go on to the end of this track. (5) Then turn to the left. (6) Straight along the avenue and you’ll come right upon it. (7) But whom do you want? (8) The count himself?”

“Well, are they at home, my good man?” Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely, not knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant. (9) “At home for sure,” said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to the other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust. (10) “Sure to be at home,” he repeated, evidently eager to talk. (11) “Only yesterday visitors arrived. (12) There’s a sight of visitors come. (13) What do you want?” He turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting something to him from the cart. (14) “Oh! (15) They all rode by here not long since, to look at a reaping machine. (16) They’ll be home by now. (17) And who will you be belonging to?...”

“We’ve come a long way,” said the coachman, climbing onto the box. (18) “So it’s not far?”

“I tell you, it’s just here. (19) As soon as you get out....” he said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage. (20) A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too. (21) “What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?” he asked. (22) “I don’t know, my boy.”

“So you keep to the left, and you’ll come right on it,” said the peasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to converse. (23) The coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted: “Stop! (24) Hi, friend! (25) Stop!” called the two voices. (26) The coachman stopped. (27) “They’re coming! (28) They’re yonder!” shouted the peasant.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) Another was Reddy Fox. (2) Blacky doubted because he knew Farmer Brown's boy so well that he couldn't imagine him afraid. (3) Reddy doubted because he didn't want to believe. (4) You see, he was jealous of Buster Bear, and at the same time he was afraid of him. (5) So Reddy pretended not to believe a word of what Little Joe Otter had said, and he agreed with Blacky that only by seeing Farmer Brown's boy afraid could he ever be made to believe it. (6) But nearly everybody else believed it, and there was great rejoicing. (7) Most of them were afraid of Buster, very much afraid of him, because he was so big and strong. (8) Butthey were still more afraid of Farmer Brown's boy, because they didn't know him or understand him, and because in the past he had tried to catch some of them in traps and had hunted some of them with his terrible gun. (9) So now they were very proud to think that one of their own number actually had frightened him, and they began to look on Buster Bear as a real hero. (10) They tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they felt and went quite out of their way to do him favors. (11) Whenever they met one another, all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear. (12) ""Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will keep away from the Green Forest, and we won't have to be all the time watching out for him,"" said BobbyCoon, as he washed his dinner in the Laughing Brook, for you know he is very neat and particular. (13) ""And he won't dare set any more traps for me,"" gloated Billy Mink. (14) ""Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown's henhouse and scare Farmer Brown's boy so that he would keep away from there. (15) It would be a favor to me which Ah cert'nly would appreciate,"" said Unc' Billy Possum when he heard the news. (16) ""Let's all go together and tell Buster Bear how much obliged we are for what he has done,"" proposed Jerry Muskrat. (17) ""That's a splendid idea!"". (18) cried Little Joe Otter. (19) ""We'll do it right away."". (20) ""Caw, caw caw!"". (21) broke in Blacky the Crow. (22) ""I say, let's wait and see for ourselves if it is all true."". (23) ""Of course it's true!"". (24) snapped Little Joe Otter. (25) ""Don't you believe I'm telling the truth?"". (26) ""Certainly, certainly. (27) Of course no one doubts your word,"" replied Blacky, with the utmost politeness.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) On the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool sat Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink, and Jerry Muskrat. (2) On his big, green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog. (3) On another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle. (4) On the bank on one side of the Smiling Pool were Peter Rabbit, Jumper the Hare, Danny Meadow Mouse, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' Billy Possum, Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr. Toad. (5) On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy Fox, Digger the Badger, and Bobby Coon. (6) In the Big Hickory-tree were Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and Sammy Jay. (7) Blacky waited until he was sure that no one else was coming. (8) Then he cleared his throat very loudly and began to speak. (9) ""Friends,"" said he. (10) Everybody grinned, for Blacky has played so many sharp tricks that no one is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker, Sammy Jay, who, you know, is Blacky's cousin. (11) But no one said anything, and Blacky went on. (12) ""Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer Brown's boy hurry home when he found the footprint of Buster Bear on the edge of the Laughing Brook, and how all the way he kept looking behind him, as if he wereafraid. (13) Perhaps he was, and then again perhaps he wasn't. (14) Perhaps he had something else on his mind. (15) You have made a hero of Buster Bear, because you believe Little Joe's story. (16) Now I don't say that I don't believe it, but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown's boy is afraid of Buster when I see him run away myself. (17) Now here is my plan:

""To-morrow morning, very early, Sammy Jay and I will make a great fuss near the edge of the Green Forest. (18) Farmer Brown's boy has a lot of curiosity, and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about. (19) Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear is. (20) If he runs away, I will be the first to admit that Buster Bear is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is. (21) It is a very simple plan, and if you will all hide where you can watch, you willbe able to see for yourselves if Little Joe Otter is right. (22) Now what do you say?"". (23) Right away everybody began to talk at the same time. (24) It was such a simple plan that everybody agreed to it. (25) And it promised to be so exciting that everybody promised to be there, that is, everybody but Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who didn't care to go so far away from the Smiling Pool. (26) So it was agreed that Blacky should try his plan the very next morning.

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. (2) Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. (3) His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. (4) Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity—that had a flush of pride in it. (5) “Shall I take her to a coach? (6) I shall never feel her weight.”

He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. (7) Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver. (8) When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms. (9) There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her. (10) “Don’t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is better so. (11) Don’t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”



“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. (12) “Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! (13) O, look at her, dear Carton! (14) Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”



He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. (15) He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. (16) “Before I go,” he said, and paused—“I may kiss her?”



It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. (17) The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”



When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:



“You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. (18) These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”



“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. (19) I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. (20) “Try them again. (21) The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.”



“I intend to try. (22) I will not rest a moment.”

“That’s well. (23) I have known such energy as yours do great things before now—though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such great things as this. (24) But try! (25) Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. (26) It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.”



“I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. (27) I will write too, and—But stay! (28) There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.”



“That’s true.

Book Title: Heidi

Book Author: Johanna Spyri

Paragraph: (1) ""What glory everywhere! (2) Clara, what do you say to it all?"". (3) Clara, looking about her rapturously, cried: ""Oh, how wonderful, how glorious! (4) I have never dreamt it could be as beautiful as that. (5) Oh grandmama, I wish I could stay here!"". (6) The uncle had busied himself in themeantime with getting Clara's rolling-chair for her. (7) Then, going up to the girl, he gently lifted her into her seat. (8) Putting some covers over her knees, he tucked her feet in warmly. (9) It seemed as if the grandfather had done nothing else all his life than nurse lame people. (10) ""My dear uncle,"" said the grandmama, surprised, ""please tell me where you learned that, for I shall send all the nurses I know here immediately."". (11) The uncle smiled faintly, while he replied: ""It comes more from care than study."". (12) His face became sad. (13) Before his eyes had risen bygone times. (14) For that was the way he used to care for his poor wounded captain, whom he had found in Sicily after a violent battle. (15) He alone had been allowed to nurse him till his death, and now he would take just as good care of poor, lame Clara. (16) When Clara had looked a long time at the cloudless sky above and all the rocky crags, she said longingly: ""I wish I could walk round the hut to the fir-trees. (17) If I only could see all the things you told me so much about!"". (18) Heidi pushed with all her might, and behold! (19) the chair rolled easily over the dry grass. (20) When they had come into the little grove, Clara could not see her fill of those splendid trees that must have stood there so many, many years. (21) Although the people had changed and vanished, they had remained the same, ever looking down into the valley. (22) When they passed the empty goat-shed, Clara said pitifully: ""Oh grandmama, if I could only wait up here for Schwänli and Bärli! (23) I am afraid I shan't see Peter and his goats, if we have to go away so soon again."". (24) ""Dear child, enjoy now what you can,"" said the grandmama, who had followed. (25) ""Oh, what wonderful flowers!"". (26) exclaimed Clara again; ""whole bushes of exquisite, red blossoms. (27) Oh, if I could only pick some of those bluebells!"". (28) Heidi, immediately gathering a large bunch, put them in Clara's lap.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) Now the lovely June days had come, everything began to look really summer-like; school would soon be over, and the young people were joyfully preparing for the long vacation. (2) “We are all going up to Bethlehem. (3) We take the seashore one year and the mountains the next. (4) Better come along,” said Gus, as the boys lay on the grass after beating the Lincolns at one of the first matches of the season. (5) “Can't; we are off to Pebbly Beach the second week in July. (6) Our invalids need sea air. (7) That one looks delicate, doesn't he?” asked Frank, giving Jack a slight rap with his bat as that young gentleman lay in his usual attitude admiring the blue hose and russet shoes which adorned his sturdy limbs. (8) “Stop that, Captain! (9) You needn't talk about invalids, when you know mother says you are not to look at a book for a month because you have studied yourself thin and headachy. (10) I'm all right;” and Jack gave himself a sounding slap on the chest, where shone the white star of the H.B.B.C. (11) “Hear the little cockerel crow! (12) you just wait till you get into the college class, and see if you don't have to study like fun,” said Gus, with unruffled composure, for he was going to Harvard next year, and felt himself already a Senior. (13) “Never shall; I don't want any of your old colleges. (14) I'm going into business as soon as I can. (15) Ed says I may be his book-keeper, if I am ready when he starts for himself. (16) That is much jollier than grinding away for four years, and then having to grind ever so many more at a profession,” said Jack, examining with interest the various knocks and bruises with which much ball-playing had adorned his hands. (17) “Much you know about it. (18) Just as well you don't mean to try, for it would take a mighty long pull and strong pull to get you in. (19) Business would suit you better, and you and Ed would make a capital partnership. (20) Devlin, Minot, & Co. sounds well, hey, Gus?”

“Very, but they are such good-natured chaps, they'd never get rich. (21) By the way, Ed came home at noon to-day sick. (22) I met him, and he looked regularly knocked up,” answered Gus, in a sober tone. (23) “I told him he'd better not go down Monday, for he wasn't well Saturday, and couldn't come to sing Sunday evening, you remember. (24) I must go right round and see what the matter is;” and Jack jumped up, with an anxious face.

Book Title: The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) He has nothing, but he looks everything. (2) What more can one desire? (3) JACK.It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character. (4) I suspect him of being untruthful. (5) [AlgernonandCecilylook at him in indignant amazement.] (6) LADY BRACKNELL.Untruthful! (7) My nephew Algernon? (8) Impossible! (9) He is an Oxonian. (10) JACK.I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. (11) This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother. (12) Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself. (13) Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward. (14) He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin. (15) And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind. (16) I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon. (17) LADY BRACKNELL.Ahem! (18) Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew’s conduct to you. (19) JACK.That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. (20) My own decision, however, is unalterable. (21) I decline to give my consent. (22) LADY BRACKNELL.[ToCecily.] (23) Come here, sweet child. (24) [Cecilygoes over.] (25) How old are you, dear? (26) CECILY.Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties. (27) LADY BRACKNELL.You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. (28) Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) One night John had to give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. (2) After I had taken it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should stay half an hour to see how the medicine settled. (3) Thomas said he would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been brought into Merrylegs' stall, and put down the lantern at their feet, that I might not be disturbed with the light. (4) For awhile both men sat silent, and then Tom Green said in a low voice:



“I wish, John, you'd say a bit of a kind word to Joe. (5) The boy is quite broken-hearted; he can't eat his meals, and he can't smile. (6) He says he knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew, and he says if Beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again. (7) It goes to my heart to hear him. (8) I think you might give him just a word; he is not a bad boy.”



After a short pause John said slowly, “You must not be too hard upon me, Tom. (9) I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a bad boy. (10) But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is more than I can bear. (11) But if you think I am hard on the boy I will try to give him a good word to-morrow—that is, I mean if Beauty is better.”



“Well, John, thank you. (12) I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am glad you see it was only ignorance.”



John's voice almost startled me as he answered:



“Only ignorance! (13) only ignorance! (14) how can you talk about only ignorance? (15) Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness? (16) and which does the most mischief heaven only knows. (17) If people can say, 'Oh! (18) I did not know, I did not mean any harm,' they think it is all right. (19) I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill that baby when she dosed it with Dalby and soothing syrups; but she did kill it, and was tried for manslaughter.”



“And serve her right, too,” said Tom. (20) “A woman should not undertake to nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad for it.”



“Bill Starkey,” continued John, “did not mean to frighten his brother into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that might have been the pride of any mother's heart is just no better than an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. (21) You were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants.”



“A good many!” said Tom; “there was not one of the tender cuttings that was not nipped off. (22) I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst of it is that I don't know where to go to get fresh ones. (23) I was nearly mad when I came in and saw what was done.”



“And yet,” said John, “I am sure the young ladies did not mean it; it was only ignorance.”



I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought of John's words when I came to know more of the world.

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) “Can you ride?”



“Well, sir, I bean't much of a horseman, but I'd risk my neck for the Lady Anne; she was uncommon good to my wife in the winter.”



“Then mount this horse, my friend—your neck will be quite safe—and ride to the doctor's and ask him to come instantly; then on to the hall; tell them all that you know, and bid them send me the carriage, with Lady Anne's maid and help. (2) I shall stay here.”

“All right, sir, I'll do my best, and I pray God the dear young lady may open her eyes soon.” Then, seeing the other man, he called out, “Here, Joe, run for some water, and tell my missis to come as quick as she can to the Lady Anne.”



He then somehow scrambled into the saddle, and with a “Gee up” and a clap on my sides with both his legs, he started on his journey, making a little circuit to avoid the dike. (3) He had no whip, which seemed to trouble him; but my pace soon cured that difficulty, and he found the best thing he could do was to stick to the saddle and hold me in, which he did manfully. (4) I shook him as little as I could help, but once or twice on the rough ground he called out, “Steady! (5) Woah! (6) Steady!” On the highroad we were all right; and at the doctor's and the hall he did his errand like a good man and true. (7) They asked him in to take a drop of something. (8) “No, no,” he said; “I'll be back to 'em again by a short cut through the fields, and be there afore the carriage.”



There was a great deal of hurry and excitement after the news became known. (9) I was just turned into my box; the saddle and bridle were taken off, and a cloth thrown over me. (10) Ginger was saddled and sent off in great haste for Lord George, and I soon heard the carriage roll out of the yard. (11) It seemed a long time before Ginger came back, and before we were left alone; and then she told me all that she had seen. (12) “I can't tell much,” she said. (13) “We went a gallop nearly all the way, and got there just as the doctor rode up. (14) There was a woman sitting on the ground with the lady's head in her lap. (15) The doctor poured something into her mouth, but all that I heard was, 'She is not dead.' (16) Then I was led off by a man to a little distance. (17) After awhile she was taken to the carriage, and we came home together. (18) I heard my master say to a gentleman who stopped him to inquire, that he hoped no bones were broken, but that she had not spoken yet.”



When Lord George took Ginger for hunting, York shook his head; he said it ought to be a steady hand to train a horse for the first season, and not a random rider like Lord George. (19) Ginger used to like it very much, but sometimes when she came back I could see that she had been very much strained, and now and then she gave a short cough. (20) She had too much spirit to complain, but I could not help feeling anxious about her. (21) Two days after the accident Blantyre paid me a visit; he patted me and praised me very much; he told Lord George that he was sure the horse knew of Annie's danger as well as he did. (22) “I could not have held him in if I would,” said he, “she ought never to ride any other horse.” I found by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger, and would soon be able to ride again. (23) This was good news to me and I looked forward to a happy life.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) And that yell was a yell of fright. (2) There was no doubt about it, for with the yell Farmer Brown's boy turned and ran for home, as no one ever had seen him run before. (3) He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has got to reach the dear Old Briar-patch before Reddy Fox can catch him, which, you know, is as fast as he can run. (4) Once he stumbled and fell, but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went without once turning his head to see if Buster Bear was after him. (5) There wasn't any doubt that he was afraid, very much afraid. (6) Everybody leaned forward to watch him. (7) ""What did I tell you? (8) Didn't I say that he was afraid of Buster Bear? (9) ""cried Little Joe Otter, dancing about with excitement. (10) ""You were right, Little Joe! (11) I'm sorry that I doubted it. (12) See him go! (13) Caw, caw, caw!"". (14) shrieked Blacky the Crow. (15) For a minute or two everybody forgot about Buster Bear. (16) Then there was a great crash which made everybody turn to look the other way. (17) What do you think they saw? (18) Why, Buster Bear was running away too, and he was running twice as fast as Farmer Brown's boy! (19) He bumped into trees and crashed through bushes and jumped over logs, and in almost no time at all he was out of sight. (20) Altogether it was the most surprising thing that the little people of the Green Forest ever had seen. (21) Buster Bear was running away, too.Page 71. (22) Sammy Jay looked at Blacky theCrow, and Blacky looked at Chatterer, and Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit, and Peter looked at Unc' Billy Possum, and Unc' Billy looked at Bobby Coon, and Bobby looked at Johnny Chuck, and Johnny looked at Reddy Fox, and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk, and Jimmy looked at Billy Mink, and Billy looked at Little Joe Otter, and for a minute nobody could say a word. (23) Then Little Joe gave a funny little gasp. (24) ""Why, why-e-e!"". (25) said he, ""I believe Buster Bear is afraid too!"". (26) Unc' Billy Possum chuckled. (27) ""Ah believe yo' are right again, Brer Otter,"" said he. (28) ""It cert'nly does look so.

Book Title: The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) the time approaches for our departure. (2) We have not a moment to lose. (3) As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune? (4) JACK.Oh! (5) about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. (6) That is all. (7) Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. (8) So pleased to have seen you. (9) LADY BRACKNELL. (10) [Sitting down again.] (11) A moment, Mr. Worthing. (12) A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! (13) And in the Funds! (14) Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. (15) Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time. (16) We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces. (17) [ToCecily.] (18) Come over here, dear. (19) [Cecilygoes across.] (20) Pretty child! (21) your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it. (22) But we can soon alter all that. (23) A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time. (24) I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her. (25) JACK.And after six months nobody knew her. (26) LADY BRACKNELL. (27) [Glares atJackfor a few moments. (28) Then bends, with a practised smile, toCecily.]

Book Title: The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) JACK.Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to. (2) LADY BRACKNELL.That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. (3) Algernon, of course, can choose for himself. (4) [Pulls out her watch.] (5) Come, dear, [Gwendolenrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. (6) To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform. (7) [EnterDr. (8) Chasuble.] (9) CHASUBLE.Everything is quite ready for the christenings. (10) LADY BRACKNELL.The christenings, sir! (11) Is not that somewhat premature? (12) CHASUBLE. (13) [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing toJackandAlgernon.] (14) Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism. (15) LADY BRACKNELL.At their age? (16) The idea is grotesque and irreligious! (17) Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized. (18) I will not hear of such excesses. (19) Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money. (20) CHASUBLE.Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon? (21) JACK.I don’t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble. (22) CHASUBLE.I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. (23) They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. (24) However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once. (25) Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry. (26) LADY BRACKNELL.[Starting.] (27) Miss Prism!

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) Later on in the evening a traveler's horse was brought in by the second hostler, and while he was cleaning him a young man with a pipe in his mouth lounged into the stable to gossip. (2) “I say, Towler,” said the hostler, “just run up the ladder into the loft and put some hay down into this horse's rack, will you? (3) only lay down your pipe.”

“All right,” said the other, and went up through the trapdoor; and I heard him step across the floor overhead and put down the hay. (4) James came in to look at us the last thing, and then the door was locked. (5) I cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was, but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why. (6) I got up; the air seemed all thick and choking. (7) I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses seemed very restless; it was quite dark, and I could see nothing, but the stable seemed full of smoke, and I hardly knew how to breathe. (8) The trapdoor had been left open, and I thought that was the place it came through. (9) I listened, and heard a soft rushing sort of noise and a low crackling and snapping. (10) I did not know what it was, but there was something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over. (11) The other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others stamping. (12) At last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a hurry and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more. (13) The first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, and they too would not stir. (14) He came to me next and tried to drag me out of the stall by force; of course that was no use. (15) He tried us all by turns and then left the stable. (16) No doubt we were very foolish, but danger seemed to be all round, and there was nobody we knew to trust in, and all was strange and uncertain. (17) The fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to breathe, but the rushing sound overhead grew louder, and as I looked upward through the bars of my empty rack I saw a red light flickering on the wall. (18) Then I heard a cry of “Fire!” outside, and the old hostler quietly and quickly came in; he got one horse out, and went to another, but the flames were playing round the trapdoor, and the roaring overhead was dreadful. (19) The next thing I heard was James' voice, quiet and cheery, as it always was.

Book Title: The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Book Author: Oscar Wilde

Paragraph: (1) LADY BRACKNELL.The line is immaterial. (2) Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me. (3) To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. (4) And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? (5) As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion—has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society. (6) JACK.May I ask you then what you would advise me to do? (7) I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness. (8) LADY BRACKNELL.I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over. (9) JACK.Well, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that. (10) I can produce the hand-bag at any moment. (11) It is in my dressing-room at home. (12) I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell. (13) LADY BRACKNELL.Me, sir! (14) What has it to do with me? (15) You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought up with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel? (16) Good morning, Mr. Worthing! (17) [Lady Bracknellsweeps out in majestic indignation.] (18) JACK.Good morning! (19) [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding March. (20) Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] (21) For goodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy. (22) How idiotic you are! (23) [The music stops andAlgernonenters cheerily.] (24) ALGERNON.Didn’t it go off all right, old boy? (25) You don’t mean to say Gwendolen refused you? (26) I know it is a way she has. (27) She is always refusing people. (28) I think it is most ill-natured of her.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) “Keep up your heart, neighbor. (2) I have an idea in my head which I think will help us all, if I can carry it out,” she said, cheerily, as she went, leaving Mrs. Pecq to sew on Jack's new night-gowns, with swift fingers, and the grateful wish that she might work for these good friends forever. (3) As if the whispering and rustling had disturbed her, Jill soon began to stir, and slowly opened the eyes which had closed so wearily on the dull December afternoon. (4) The bare wall with its brown spiders no longer confronted her, but the colored print of a little girl dancing to the tune her father was playing on a guitar, while a stately lady, with satin dress, ruff, and powder, stood looking on, well pleased. (5) The quaint figure, in its belaced frock, quilted petticoat, and red-heeled shoes, seemed to come tripping toward her in such a life-like way, that she almost saw the curls blow back, heard the rustle of the rich brocade, and caught the sparkle of the little maid's bright eyes. (6) “Oh, how pretty! (7) Who sent them?” asked Jill, eagerly, as her eye glanced along the wall, seeing other new and interesting things beyond: an elephant-hunt, a ship in full sail, a horse-race, and a ball-room. (8) “The good fairy who never comes empty-handed. (9) Look round a bit and you will see more pretties all for you, my dearie;” and her mother pointed to a bunch of purple grapes in a green leaf plate, a knot of bright flowers pinned on the white curtain, and a gay little double gown across the foot of the bed. (10) Jill clapped her hands, and was enjoying her new pleasures, when in came Merry and Molly Loo, with Boo, of course, trotting after her like a fat and amiable puppy. (11) Then the good times began; the gown was put on, the fruit tasted, and the pictures were studied like famous works of art. (12) “It's a splendid plan to cover up that hateful wall. (13) I'd stick pictures all round and have a gallery. (14) That reminds me! (15) Up in the garret at our house is a box full of old fashion-books my aunt left. (16) I often look at them on rainy days, and they are very funny. (17) I'll go this minute and get every one. (18) We can pin them up, or make paper dolls;” and away rushed Molly Loo, with the small brother waddling behind, for, when he lost sight of her, he was desolate indeed. (19) The girls had fits of laughter over the queer costumes of years gone by, and put up a splendid procession of ladies in full skirts, towering hats, pointed slippers, powdered hair, simpering faces, and impossible waists. (20) “I do think this bride is perfectly splendid, the long train and veil aresosweet,” said Jill, revelling in fine clothes as she turned from one plate to another. (21) “I like the elephants best, and I'd give anything to go on a hunt like that!” cried Molly Loo, who rode cows, drove any horse she could get, had nine cats, and was not afraid of the biggest dog that ever barked. (22) “I fancy 'The Dancing Lesson;' it is so sort of splendid, with the great windows, gold chairs, and fine folks. (23) Oh, I would like to live in a castle with a father and mother like that,” said Merry, who was romantic, and found the old farmhouse on the hill a sad trial to her high-flown ideas of elegance. (24) “Now, that ship, setting out for some far-away place, is more to my mind. (25) I weary for home now and then, and mean to see it again some day;” and Mrs. Pecq looked longingly at the English ship, though it was evidently outward bound. (26) Then, as if reproaching herself for discontent, she added: “It looks like those I used to see going off to India with a load of missionaries. (27) I came near going myself once, with a lady bound for Siam; but I went to Canada with her sister, and here I am.”



“I'd like to be a missionary and go where folks throw their babies to the crocodiles.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) He's so faithful he does more than his share, and gets tired out. (2) Mother asked him to come down and see us when he has his vacation; we are going to have high old times fishing and boating. (3) Up or down?” asked Jack, as they glided out into the river. (4) Gus looked both ways, and seeing another boat with a glimpse of red in it just going round the bend, answered, with decision, “Up, of course. (5) Don't we always pull to the bridge?”

“Not when the girls are going down,” laughed Jack, who had recognized Juliet's scarlet boating-suit as he glanced over his shoulder. (6) “Mind what you are about, and don't gabble,” commanded Captain Frank, as the crew bent to their oars and the slender boat cut through the water leaving a long furrow trembling behind. (7) “Oh, ah! (8) I see! (9) There is a blue jacket as well as a red one, so it's all right. (10) sung Jack, recovering his spirits, and wishing Jill was there too. (11) “Do you want a ducking?” sternly demanded Gus, anxious to preserve discipline. (12) “Shouldn't mind, its so warm.”

But Jack said no more, and soon the “Rhodora” was alongside the “Water Witch,” exchanging greetings in the most amiable manner. (13) “Pity this boat won't hold four. (14) We'd put Jack in yours, and take you girls a nice spin up to the Hemlocks,” said Frank, whose idea of bliss was floating down the river with Annette as coxswain. (15) “You'd better come in here, this will hold four, and we are tired of rowing,” returned the “Water Witch,” so invitingly that Gus could not resist. (16) “I don't think it is safe to put four in there. (17) You'd better change places with Annette, Gus, and then we shall be ship-shape,” said Frank, answering a telegram from the eyes that matched the blue jacket. (18) “Wouldn't it bemoreship-shape still if you put me ashore at Grif's landing? (19) I can take his boat, or wait till you come back. (20) Don't care what I do,” said Jack, feeling himself sadly in the way. (21) The good-natured offer being accepted with thanks, the changes were made, and, leaving him behind, the two boats went gayly up the river. (22) He really did not care what he did, so sat in Grif's boat awhile watching the red sky, the shining stream, and the low green meadows, where the blackbirds were singing as if they too had met their little sweethearts and were happy. (23) Jack remembered that quiet half-hour long afterward, because what followed seemed to impress it on his memory. (24) As he sat enjoying the scene, he very naturally thought about Ed; for the face of the sister whom he saw was very anxious, and the word “fever” recalled the hard times when Frank was ill, particularly the night it was thought the boy would not live till dawn, and Jack cried himself to sleep, wondering how he ever could get on without his brother. (25) Ed was almost as dear to him, and the thought that he was suffering destroyed Jack's pleasure for a little while. (26) But, fortunately, young people do not know how to be anxious very long, so our boy soon cheered up, thinking about the late match between the Stars and the Lincolns, and after a good rest went whistling home, with a handful of mint for Mrs. Pecq, and played games with Jill as merrily as if there was no such thing as care in the world. (27) Next day Ed was worse, and for a week the answer was the same, when Jack crept to the back door with his eager question.

Book Title: The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) here was no hope, not the teeniest, weeniest ray of hope in the heart of Chatterer, as Farmer Brown's boy picked up the wire rat-trap and started for the house, Black Pussy, the cat, following at his heels and looking up at Chatterer with cruel, hungry eyes. (2) Chatterer took a farewell look at the Old Orchard and way beyond it the Green Forest, from which he had been driven by fear of Shadow the Weasel. (3) Then the door of the farmhouse closed and shut it all out. (4) If there had been any hope in Chatterer's heart, the closing of thatdoor would have shut the last bit out. (5) But there wasn't any hope. (6) Chatterer was sure that he was to be given to Black Pussy for her breakfast. (7) Farmer Brown's boy put the trap on a table. (8) ""What have you there?"". (9) called a great voice. (10) It was the voice of Farmer Brown himself, who was eating his breakfast. (11) ""I've got the thief who has been stealing our corn in the crib,"" replied Farmer Brown's boy, ""and who do you think it is?"". (12) ""One of those pesky rats,"" replied Farmer Brown. (13) ""I'm afraid you've been careless and left the door open some time, and that is how the rats have got in there."". (14) ""But it isn't a rat, and I don't believe that there is a rat there,"" replied Farmer Brown's boy in triumph. (15) ""It's that little scamp of a red squirrelwe've seen racing along the wall at the edge of the Old Orchard lately. (16) I can't imagine how he got in there, but there he was, and now here he is."". (17) ""What are you going to do with him?"". (18) asked Farmer Brown, coming over to look at Chatterer. (19) ""I don't know,"" replied Farmer Brown's boy, ""unless I give him to Black Puss for her breakfast. (20) She has been teasing me for him ever since I found him. (21) "".

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in a short jacket and tight trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. (2) Seeing Levin, he shouted to him:

“Ah, the first skater in Russia! (3) Been here long? (4) First-rate ice—do put your skates on.”

“I haven’t got my skates,” Levin answered, marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her, though he did not look at her. (5) He felt as though the sun were coming near him. (6) She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him. (7) A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her. (8) She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him, and at her own fears. (9) When she had got round the turn, she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky. (10) Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin. (11) She was more splendid than he had imagined her. (12) When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor. (13) The childishness of her expression, together with the delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he fully realized. (14) But what always struck him in her as something unlooked for, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and above all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood. (15) “Have you been here long?” she said, giving him her hand. (16) “Thank you,” she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff. (17) “I? (18) I’ve not long ... yesterday ... (19) I mean today ... (20) I arrived,” answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question. (21) “I was meaning to come and see you,” he said; and then, recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed. (22) “I didn’t know you could skate, and skate so well.”



She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion. (23) “Your praise is worth having. (24) The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters,” she said, with her little black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff. (25) “Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.”



“You do everything with passion, I think,” she said smiling. (26) “I should so like to see how you skate. (27) Put on skates, and let us skate together.”

“Skate together!

Book Title: Black Beauty

Book Author: Anna Sewell

Paragraph: (1) Some of the sights I saw there, where a horse had to come downhill with a heavily loaded two-wheel cart behind him, on which no brake could be placed, make me sad even now to think of. (2) After Rory was disabled I often went in the carriage with a mare named Peggy, who stood in the next stall to mine. (3) She was a strong, well-made animal, of a bright dun color, beautifully dappled, and with a dark-brown mane and tail. (4) There was no high breeding about her, but she was very pretty and remarkably sweet-tempered and willing. (5) Still, there was an anxious look about her eye, by which I knew that she had some trouble. (6) The first time we went out together I thought she had a very odd pace; she seemed to go partly a trot, partly a canter, three or four paces, and then a little jump forward. (7) It was very unpleasant for any horse who pulled with her, and made me quite fidgety. (8) When we got home I asked her what made her go in that odd, awkward way. (9) “Ah,” she said in a troubled manner, “I know my paces are very bad, but what can I do? (10) It really is not my fault; it is just because my legs are so short. (11) I stand nearly as high as you, but your legs are a good three inches longer above your knee than mine, and of course you can take a much longer step and go much faster. (12) You see I did not make myself. (13) I wish I could have done so; I would have had long legs then. (14) All my troubles come from my short legs,” said Peggy, in a desponding tone. (15) “But how is it,” I said, “when you are so strong and good-tempered and willing?”



“Why, you see,” said she, “men will go so fast, and if one can't keep up to other horses it is nothing but whip, whip, whip, all the time. (16) And so I have had to keep up as I could, and have got into this ugly shuffling pace. (17) It was not always so; when I lived with my first master I always went a good regular trot, but then he was not in such a hurry. (18) He was a young clergyman in the country, and a good, kind master he was. (19) He had two churches a good way apart, and a great deal of work, but he never scolded or whipped me for not going faster. (20) He was very fond of me. (21) I only wish I was with him now; but he had to leave and go to a large town, and then I was sold to a farmer. (22) “Some farmers, you know, are capital masters; but I think this one was a low sort of man. (23) He cared nothing about good horses or good driving; he only cared for going fast. (24) I went as fast as I could, but that would not do, and he was always whipping; so I got into this way of making a spring forward to keep up. (25) On market nights he used to stay very late at the inn, and then drive home at a gallop. (26) “One dark night he was galloping home as usual, when all of a sudden the wheel came against some great heavy thing in the road, and turned the gig over in a minute. (27) He was thrown out and his arm broken, and some of his ribs, I think.

Book Title: A Tale of Two Cities

Book Author: Charles Dickens

Paragraph: (1) “If I might touch him! (2) If I might embrace him once! (3) O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!”



There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad. (4) The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. (5) Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms. (6) “Farewell, dear darling of my soul. (7) My parting blessing on my love. (8) We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”



They were her husband’s words, as he held her to his bosom. (9) “I can bear it, dear Charles. (10) I am supported from above: don’t suffer for me. (11) A parting blessing for our child.”

“I send it to her by you. (12) I kiss her by you. (13) I say farewell to her by you.”

“My husband. (14) No! (15) A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from her. (16) “We shall not be separated long. (17) I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”



Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:



“No, no! (18) What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! (19) We know now, what a struggle you made of old. (20) We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. (21) We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. (22) We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. (23) Heaven be with you!”

Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish. (24) “It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. (25) “All things have worked together as they have fallen out. (26) It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother’s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. (27) Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. (28) Be comforted, and forgive me.

Book Title: The Adventures of Buster Bear

Book Author: Thornton W. Burgess

Paragraph: (1) He was in the Old Pasture, one edge of which touches one edge of the Green Forest. (2) And where do you think he was, in the Old Pasture? (3) Why, right in the middle of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all his life! (4) Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have above another, it is all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey. (5) Nothingcan quite equal honey in Buster's mind. (6) But next to honey give him berries. (7) He isn't particular what kind of berries. (8) Raspberries, blackberries, or blueberries, either kind, will make him perfectly happy. (9) ""Um-m-m, my, my, but these are good!"". (10) he mumbled in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat on his haunches stripping off the berries greedily. (11) His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and he didn't mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and some green berries in his mouth with the big ripe berries. (12) He didn't try to get them out. (13) Oh, my, no! (14) He just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from sheer delight. (15) Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had crept out of bed, and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back in theGreen Forest before Mr. Sun had climbed very far up in the blue, blue sky. (16) You see, big as he is and strong as he is, Buster Bear is very shy and bashful, and he has no desire to meet Farmer Brown, or Farmer Brown's boy, or any other of those two-legged creatures called men. (17) It seems funny but he actually is afraid of them. (18) And he had a feeling that he was a great deal more likely to meet one of them in the Old Pasture than deep in the Green Forest. (19) So when he started to look for berries, he made up his mind that he would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the Green Forest before Farmer Brown's boy was more than out of bed. (20) But when he found those berries he was so hungry that he forgot his fears and everything else. (21) They tasted so good that he just had to eat and eatand eat. (22) Now you know that Buster is a very big fellow, and it takes a lot to fill him up. (23) He kept eating and eating and eating, and the more he ate the more he wanted. (24) You know how it is. (25) So he wandered from one patch of berries to another in the Old Pasture, and never once thought of the time. (26) Somehow, time is the hardest thing in the world to remember, when you are having a good time. (27) Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and higher in the blue, blue sky. (28) He looked down on all the Great World and saw all that was going on.

Book Title: Jack and Jill

Book Author: Louisa May Alcott

Paragraph: (1) I thought you might have told her to.”



“I've said nothing. (2) Don't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it. (3) I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint. (4) Is she going to upset the whole place?” asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect. (5) “I hope so, for I really am ashamed when people come, to have them see the dust and cobwebs, and old carpets and dirty windows,” said Molly, with a sigh, though she never had cared a bit till lately. (6) “Why don't you dust round a little, then? (7) No time to spare from the books and play?”

“I tried, father, but Miss Bat didn't like it, and it was too hard for me alone. (8) If things were once in nice order, I think I could keep them so; for I do want to be neat, and I'm learning as fast as I can.”



“It is high time someone took hold, if matters are left as you say. (9) I've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was, to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town, and wondering what I could give the old lady. (10) Now I findyouare the one to be thanked, and it is a very pleasant surprise to me.”



“Give her the present, please; I'm satisfied, if you like what I've done. (11) It isn't much, and I didn't know as you would ever observe any difference. (12) But I did try, and now I guess I'm really getting on,” said Molly, sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks, for she, too, found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes. (13) “You certainly are, my dear. (14) I'll wait till the house-cleaning is over, and then, if we are all alive, I'll see about Miss Bat's reward. (15) Meantime, you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need, and send the bills to me;” and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar, as if that matter was settled. (16) “Oh, thank you, sir! (17) That will be splendid. (18) Merry always has pretty things, and I know you will like me when I get fixed,” said Molly, smoothing down her apron, with a little air. (19) “Seems to me you look very well as you are. (20) Isn't that a pretty enough frock?” asked Mr. Bemis, quite unconscious that his own unusual interest in his daughter's affairs made her look so bright and winsome. (21) “This? (22) Why, father, I've worn it all winter, and it'sfrightfullyugly, and almost in rags. (23) I asked you for a new one a month ago, and you said you'd 'see about it'; but you didn't, so I patched this up as well as I could;” and Molly showed her elbows, feeling that such masculine blindness as this deserved a mild reproof. (24) “Too bad! (25) Well, go and get half a dozen pretty muslin and gingham things, and be as gay as a butterfly, to make up for it,” laughed her father, really touched by the patches and Molly's resignation to the unreliable “I'll see about it,” which he recognized as a household word. (26) Molly clapped her hands, old gloves and all, exclaiming, with girlish delight, “How nice it will seem to have a plenty of new, neat dresses all at once, and be like other girls! (27) Miss Bat always talks about economy, and has no more taste than a—caterpillar.” Molly meant to say “cat,” but remembering her pets, spared them the insult.

Book Title: Anna Karenina

Book Author: graf Leo Tolstoy

Paragraph: (1) “What did I come for? (2) What have I to say to them?”

As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and severe face. (3) On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the little drawing-room, where he heard voices. (4) In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew. (5) Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down beside the sofa with his hat on his knees. (6) “How is your wife? (7) Have you been at the concert? (8) We couldn’t go. (9) Mamma had to be at the funeral service.”

“Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!” said Levin. (10) The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his wife and inquired about the concert. (11) Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina’s sudden death. (12) “But she was always in weak health.”

“Were you at the opera yesterday?”



“Yes, I was.”



“Lucca was very good.”



“Yes, very good,” he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to him what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer’s talent. (13) Countess Bola pretended to be listening. (14) Then, when he had said enough and paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk. (15) The colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture. (16) At last, after speaking of the proposedfolle journéeat Turin’s, the colonel laughed, got up noisily, and went away. (17) Levin too rose, but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go. (18) He must stay two minutes longer. (19) He sat down. (20) But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent. (21) “You are not going to the public meeting? (22) They say it will be very interesting,” began the countess. (23) “No, I promised mybelle-sœurto fetch her from it,” said Levin. (24) A silence followed. (25) The mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter. (26) “Well, now I think the time has come,” thought Levin, and he got up. (27) The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to saymille chosesto his wife for them.
