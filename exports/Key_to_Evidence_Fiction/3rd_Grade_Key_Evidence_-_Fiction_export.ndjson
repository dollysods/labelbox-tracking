(2) After helping him, the soldier let him go. (3) The next day, the soldier's friends, a captain and a lieutenant, came back and were surprised to see the soldier safe. (4) The soldier shared his whole adventure with them and told them about some princesses who needed to be rescued. (5) Excited to help, the captain, the lieutenant, and the soldier prepared for their journey. (6) They packed a big basket, grabbed lots of rope, and headed to a mysterious mound.\n\n (7) At the mound, they followed the old man's instructions and dug up the ground until they found a huge stone slab. (8) It was so heavy that all three had to work together to move it. (9) After removing the slab, they saw a deep hole and tried to measure it with their ropes. (10) They attached the ropes together until they finally reached the bottom.\n\n (11) The captain decided to go down first. (12) He told his friends, \"Pull me up quickly if I tug on the rope!\". (13) Descending into the darkness, he felt scared when cold water sprayed over him. (14) He tugged the rope, and his friends quickly pulled him up.\n\n (15) Next, the lieutenant tried his luck, but he too got scared by a fire below and came back up.\n\n (16) Then it was the soldier's turn. (17) He bravely went down through the fire and water until he reached the bottom. (18) It was so dark, he could barely see anything. (19) Holding tightly to the basket, he walked around until he saw a faint light in the distance. (20) He followed the light, and soon everything around him started to brighten.\n\n (21) As he walked further, he saw the sun rising and the world transforming into a place as lovely as a fairy tale. (22) He walked past some shiny, fat cattle and reached a grand palace. (23) Inside the palace, he wandered through many rooms without seeing anyone.\n\n (24) Finally, he heard the sound of a spinning wheel. (25) He followed the sound and found the oldest princess spinning copper yarn in a room full of copper. (26) The princess looked up, surprised, and said, \"Oh, dear! (27) What are Christian people doing here? (28) Heaven preserve you! (29) What do you want?\". (30) The soldier smiled and knew his adventure was just beginning.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What was the soldier\\\"s reaction to beginning

(2) Nearby, Hugh Whitbread was looking at a fancy Spanish necklace. (3) He thought maybe Evelyn would like it. (4) Richard felt really slow and couldn't decide what to do. (5) He just watched. (6) Evelyn might want to buy the necklace. (7) Richard yawned. (8) He really wasn't interested, but Hugh was about to enter the shop.\n\n (9) \"Okay, let's go,\" Richard said, following Hugh inside.\n\n (10) Richard didn't really want to go shopping for necklaces with Hugh. (11) But sometimes, you just end up doing things. (12) Hugh was talking about getting the necklace for Evelyn. (13) Richard thought about how silly it all seemed, buying necklaces for someone.\n\n (14) If Richard had a son, he would tell him to work hard. (15) But he had his daughter, Elizabeth, and he loved her so much.\n\n (16) Inside the shop, Hugh talked to the shopkeeper. (17) He wanted to know if Mr. Dubonnet was there. (18) Mr. Dubonnet knew exactly what jewelry Evelyn liked. (19) Richard found this all very strange. (20) Richard thought about his wife, Clarissa. (21) He hadn't given her a gift in a long time. (22) He remembered giving her a bracelet that she never wore. (23) That made him a bit sad. (24) He wanted to find her the perfect gift. (25) Hugh was talking loudly and didn't want to buy anything unless Mr. Dubonnet was there. (26) The young shop assistant looked embarrassed. (27) Richard couldn't believe how rude Hugh was acting. (28) He couldn't spend much more time with him. (29) Tipping his hat, Richard decided to leave. (30) He really wanted to see Clarissa and give her a special gift.

(2) Mrs. Brown called out, looking very tired. (3) \"You've been playing that noisy game again!\". (4) William, who was all dusty and messy, with his tie crooked and his knees scraped, looked up. (5) \"No, I wasn't playing the game you told me not to,\" he said, trying to explain. (6) \"You said not to play 'Lions and Tamers.' (7) I didn't play that game at all!\". (8) Mrs. Brown sighed. (9) \"Then what were you playing?\". (10) she asked, trying to understand. (11) \"We were playing 'Tigers and Tamers,'\" William answered quickly. (12) \"It's a totally different game.\". (13) Mrs. Brown was confused. (14) \"What do you do in 'Tigers and Tamers'?\". (15) she asked, a bit suspicious. (16) William thought for a moment. (17) \"Well, in 'Tigers and Tamers,' some of us pretend to be tigers and the others are tamers. (18) But it's different from 'Lions and Tamers,'\" he insisted.\n\n (19) Mrs. Brown wasn't convinced. (20) \"It sounds the same to me,\" she said. (21) \"But it's not!\". (22) William said firmly. (23) \"A lion isn't the same as a tiger. (24) They're different!\". (25) Mrs. Brown decided right then. (26) \"Okay, William, now you're not to play 'Tigers and Tamers' either,\" she told him.\n\n (27) William looked surprised. (28) \"But I've been so clean today,\" he protested. (29) \"I washed my face when I woke up and again for dinner, just like you told me!\".\n\n (30) Mrs. Brown couldn't help but smile a little, even though she was trying to be firm. (31) \"Go wash up again, please,\" she said.

(3) Ugh! (4) I smell humans in my house,\" growled the troll, sniffing around with his nine big noses.\n\n (5) A princess quickly said, \"Oh, a raven dropped a human bone down the chimney earlier! (6) I tried to throw it out, but it kept coming back. (7) I finally buried it, and cleaned up, but maybe the smell is still here.\".\n\n (8) \"I definitely smell it,\" the troll replied.\n\n (9) The princess had an idea. (10) \"Why don't you lay your heads in my lap and I'll scratch them? (11) The smell will go away while you sleep.\". (12) The troll agreed and soon he was fast asleep, snoring loudly. (13) The princess then placed stools and cushions under his heads so she could sneak away.\n\n (14) A soldier tiptoed in quietly and struck the troll. (15) With one big swing, he chopped off eight of the troll's heads. (16) But the sword was too short to reach the last head, which woke up and roared.\n\n (17) \"Ugh! (18) Ugh! (19) I smell a human!\". (20) \"Here I am!\". (21) the soldier said bravely. (22) Before the troll could move, the soldier struck again, and the last head rolled away.\n\n (23) Imagine how happy the princesses were now that the troll was gone. (24) They no longer had to sit there scratching his heads. (25) They were so thankful to the soldier. (26) The youngest princess even tied her gold ring in his hair as a thank you gift.\n\n (27) They gathered as much gold and silver as they could carry and started their journey home.\n\n (28) When it was time, they pulled on a rope and a captain and a lieutenant helped pull up the princesses one by one.\n\n (29) However, the soldier didn't trust his friends fully. (30) He decided to test them by sending up a heavy lump of gold first. (31) When the gold was halfway up, the others cut the rope, and it crashed to the ground.\n\n (32) \"Now we're rid of him,\" the friends said, thinking they had tricked the soldier.\n\n (33) They frightened the princesses and made them promise to say that they were the ones who saved them from the troll. (34) The princesses didn't want to lie, but they were too scared not to agree. (35) Especially the youngest princess felt really sad about this. (36) But they knew they had to stay safe, so they agreed, even though they didn't want to.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Why did the princesses

(2) \"It's just a lost dog,\" he said quietly. (3) \"It doesn't need much to be happy. (4) It can sleep in my room and eat leftovers.\". (5) His dad, Mr. Brown, walked away without saying anything.\n\n (6) \"You need to take the dog to the Police Station, William,\" his mom, Mrs. Brown, told him. (7) \"You know where it is, right? (8) Do you want me to come with you?\". (9) \"No, thank you,\" William replied quickly.\n\n (10) Soon, he was walking to the Police Station. (11) The dog, named Jumble, followed happily, not knowing what was going to happen.\n\n (12) William looked serious as they walked. (13) But as they got closer to the Police Station, he looked a bit happier. (14) When they reached the gate, Jumble got excited and wagged his tail, thinking it was playtime.\n\n (15) \"Here we are,\" William told the dog. (16) \"This is the Police Station.\". (17) Jumble barked loudly, as if he was ready to play or race.\n\n (18) \"Go on in,\" William said, pointing to the door.\n\n (19) Jumble started playing with a big stone on the road, pushing it with his paws and chasing after it.\n\n (20) \"This is the Police Station,\" William repeated. (21) \"You can go in if you want.\". (22) Then, William turned around and walked back home. (23) He called out encouraging words to Jumble, like \"Hey, Jumble!\". (24) and whistled for him. (25) Jumble followed him all the way back, both of them happy.\n\n (26) When they got home, nobody was outside, nobody was in the hallway, and nobody was on the stairs. (27) It seemed like luck was on their side today. (28) At dinnertime, William showed up clean and tidy, looking very proud of himself.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who showed up clean and tidy at

(2) she asked Lady Bradshaw. (3) \"He just missed his eleventh birthday because he had the mumps,\" replied Lady Bradshaw. (4) \"His dad was really upset about it, maybe even more than he was!\".\n\n (5) Clarissa glanced at Sir William, who was chatting with Richard. (6) He definitely didn't look like a boy. (7) She remembered once going to him for advice, which was really sensible. (8) But, oh, how happy she was to leave his office! (9) She recalled hearing someone crying in his waiting room.\n\n (10) Clarissa couldn't quite pinpoint what it was about Sir William she didn't like. (11) Richard felt the same way, mentioning he didn't like Sir William's taste or smell. (12) Yet, everyone knew Sir William was very smart. (13) They were talking about some important Bill. (14) Sir William mentioned a case that was related to the bill, something about the long-term effects of being shocked during war. (15) They thought it should be included in the Bill. (16) As they spoke, Lady Bradshaw whispered to Mrs. Dalloway, sharing her worries about how hard their husbands worked. (17) \"Right before we left today, my husband had to take a sad phone call,\" Lady Bradshaw shared. (18) \"A young man, a former soldier, had taken his own life.\".\n\n (19) Clarissa thought about her party and suddenly felt sad. (20) \"Death at my party?\". (21) she thought. (22) She walked into a smaller room, hoping to find some guests there. (23) But the room was empty. (24) She could still sense where the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton had sat, discussing serious matters like India. (25) But now, it was just her in her fancy dress. (26) \"Why would the Bradshaws bring up such a sad topic at my party?\". (27) Clarissa wondered. (28) She thought about the young man who had died. (29) The news gave her a shock every time she heard about such tragedies, feeling a rush of emotions. (30) He had jumped from a window, and Clarissa imagined the terrible fall.\n\n (31) But why did he do it? (32) That question haunted her. (33) Clarissa had once thrown a coin into a lake, but this young man had thrown his whole life away. (34) She thought about how life goes on, how her party was still bustling with people and conversations.\n\n (35) All day, Clarissa had been reminiscing about old friends and past times. (36) Even though days were filled with idle talk and little white lies, there were things that truly mattered, things that lasted beyond the daily noise.\n\n (37) In her heart, Clarissa knew that in some way, choosing death was this young man's way of trying to say something profound, something about the loneliness and struggles of life.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r08jgq3pak07398ruie871", "global_key": "b4945_3_12", "row_data": "Grade level: 3 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Notes from the Underground\n\nBook Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nParagraph: (1) “You are a scoundrel,” a thought flashed through my mind, “if you laugh at this now.”\n\n\n\n“No matter!” I cried, answering myself. (2) “Now everything is lost!”\n\nThere was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference—I knew where they had gone.\n\n (3) At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough peasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were warm, snow. (4) It was hot and steamy. (5) The little shaggy piebald horse was also covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. (6) I made a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.\n\n (7) “No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,” I cried. (8) “But I will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. (9) Start!”\n\nWe set off. (10) There was a perfect whirl in my head. (11) “They won’t go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. (12) That is a mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical—that’s another ball on Lake Como. (13) And so I am bound to slap Zverkov’s face! (14) It is my duty to. (15) And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in the face. (16) Hurry up!”\n\nThe driver tugged at the reins.\n\n (17) “As soon as I go in I’ll give it him. (18) Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface? (19) No. (20) I’ll simply go in and give it him. (21) They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with Olympia on the sofa. (22) That damned Olympia! (23) She laughed at my looks on one occasion and refused me. (24) I’ll pull Olympia’s hair, pull Zverkov’s ears! (25) No, better one ear, and pull him by it round the room. (26) Maybe they will all begin beating me and will kick me out. (27) That’s most likely, indeed. (28) No matter! (29) Anyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative will be mine; and by the laws of honour that is everything: he will be branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows, by nothing but a duel. (30) He will be forced to fight. (31) And let them beat me now. (32) Let them, the ungrateful wretches! (33) Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he is so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my hair. (34) But no matter, no matter! (35) That’s what I am going for. (36) The blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all! (37) When they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that in reality they are not worth my little finger. (38) Get on, driver, get on!” I cried to the driver. (39) He started and flicked his whip, I shouted so savagely.\n\n (40) “We shall fight at daybreak, that’s a settled thing. (41) I’ve done with the office. (42) Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now. (43) But where can I get pistols? (44) Nonsense! (45) I’ll get my salary in advance and buy them. (46) And powder, and bullets? (47) That’s the second’s business. (48) And how can it all be done by daybreak? (49) and where am I to get a second? (50) I have no friends. (51) Nonsense!” I cried, lashing myself up more and more. (52) “It’s of no consequence!

(2) I thought they were all very similar and not very interesting. (3) Sometimes I felt they were better than me, and other times I felt they were not. (4) This made me feel really mixed up inside. (5) I was also very shy. (6) Whenever someone looked at me, I would look away first. (7) I was always the first to stop looking. (8) This made me feel nervous and worried a lot. (9) I liked to do things just like everyone else and was scared of being different. (10) I wanted to fit in and not stand out. (11) This was really important to me. (12) Even though I felt this way, sometimes I thought I was the only one who felt scared or weak at my job. (13) I thought this because I believed I thought about things more deeply than the others.\n\n (14) I also worried because I felt I was different from everyone else. (15) I felt all alone. (16) This made me quite sad and confused. (17) Going to work was very hard for me sometimes. (18) There were days when I would come home feeling sick because I didn't want to go to work. (19) But then, suddenly, I would feel okay about everything and wonder why I made such a big deal about it. (20) I would laugh at myself for being too sensitive or picky.\n\n (21) Sometimes, I did not want to talk to anyone, but other times, I felt like making friends. (22) My feelings changed a lot, and I did not understand why.\n\n (23) Once, I even became friends with my coworkers. (24) I visited their homes, played games with them, and talked about many things. (25) This was a big change for me.

(4) They were all so into what they were doing, they didn't talk to me!\".\n\n (5) Just then, he heard two boars talking. (6) One boar was skeptical and said, \"That's nonsense! (7) I bet they'll talk to me. (8) I'll find out what's really going on!\". (9) As the boars walked past, they didn't see my dad because he quickly hid. (10) They were heading to see a lion whose mane was tied up with ribbons. (11) They were sure to be surprised! (12) My dad kept walking and reached a place where three signs stood. (13) One sign pointed straight and read \"Beginning of the River.\". (14) Another pointed left and said, \"Ocean Rocks.\". (15) The third sign pointed right and said, \"DragonFerry.\". (16) My dad was trying to decide which way to go when he heard footsteps.\n\n (17) He quickly hid behind the signpost. (18) A beautiful lioness walked by. (19) She was so proud and busy looking at her reflection, she didn't even see my dad hiding. (20) My dad thought, \"That's the lion's mom! (21) The dragon must be close by!\". (22) He decided to follow the path towards the river. (23) But the river was farther than he thought. (24) When he finally got there, it was late afternoon.

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r08jh63pan07393cqnbzhq", "global_key": "2c88c_3_1", "row_data": "Grade level: 3 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Persuasion\n\nBook Author: Jane Austen\n\nParagraph: (1) There was a large, green meadow that ended at a small lane. (2) The group of friends had just reached the gate at the end of the meadow when they heard a carriage coming close. (3) It turned out to be Admiral Croft’s carriage. (4) He and his wife were just coming back from a drive.\n\n (5) When the Crofts realized how far the young friends had walked, they offered a ride to anyone who was very tired. (6) They said it would save them from walking a whole mile more as they were heading towards Uppercross. (7) But none of the young women accepted the offer. (8) The Miss Musgroves didn’t feel tired, and Mary didn’t want to ride unless she was asked first.\n\n (9) As the friends crossed the lane and climbed over a fence, Admiral Croft started to move his carriage again. (10) Suddenly, Captain Wentworth jumped over the hedge to talk to his sister. (11) Whatever he said made Mrs. Croft speak up. (12) “Miss Elliot, you must be tired,” Mrs. Croft called out. (13) “Please let us take you home. (14) There’s plenty of room in here for three. (15) Really, you must join us.”\n\nAnne was hesitating in the lane, trying to say no, but both Admiral Croft and his wife insisted kindly. (16) They even squeezed together to make space for her in the carriage. (17) Captain Wentworth didn’t say anything; he just helped her into the carriage.\n\n (18) Anne felt that Captain Wentworth had helped her because he knew she was tired and needed to rest. (19) It showed that he still cared about her a little, even though they had had some disagreements in the past.\n\n (20) She was touched by his kindness. (21) Sitting in the carriage, she felt a mix of happy and sad feelings. (22) Anne knew Captain Wentworth was still upset about their past, but he also couldn’t ignore her discomfort and stepped in to help.\n\n (23) The ride was bumpy, and at first, Anne didn’t pay much attention to the conversation. (24) Then she realized they were talking about “Frederick.”\n\n\n\nAdmiral Croft guessed that Frederick was deciding between two girls he liked.

(4) \"I think he travels for work. (5) Right now, he's in Hull.\". (6) Septimus shaded his eyes to see Rezia better. (7) He looked at her face bit by bit - her chin, her nose, her forehead. (8) Everything looked normal as she sewed. (9) She had a focused look on her face, like many people do when they are concentrating.\n\n (10) He looked at her again and again. (11) There was nothing scary about her. (12) She was just sewing in the daylight. (13) Mr. Peters was away in Hull, so why worry about anything else? (14) Rezia was right there, sewing a dress. (15) \"It's too small for Mrs. Peters,\" Septimus suddenly said.\n\n (16) He hadn’t spoken so casually in days. (17) Rezia agreed, \"Yes, it's quite small.\". (18) He joked that it looked like a hat for a monkey. (19) They both laughed. (20) It had been a long time since they had laughed together like this.\n\n (21) Rezia added a rose to the hat. (22) She felt very happy. (23) \"That makes it look even more silly,\" Septimus laughed, saying it made Mrs. Peters look like a pig at a fair.\n\n (24) Rezia had many things in her sewing box - ribbons, beads, and flowers. (25) She poured them out on the table. (26) Septimus started picking colors and pieces for the hat, even though he wasn’t good with his hands. (27) He had a good eye for design though. (28) \"We'll make a beautiful hat!\". (29) he said, picking up different items. (30) Rezia knelt beside him to help. (31) \"Now it's designed,\" he said. (32) \"You need to sew it carefully, just like I set it out.\".\n\n (33) So, Rezia sewed. (34) As she worked, she made soft sounds, like a kettle bubbling. (35) Her fingers moved quickly, pushing and pulling the needle.\n\n (36) As she sewed, Septimus stretched out, feeling relaxed in the warmth of the room. (37) It reminded him of a cozy spot in the woods, where it's always a bit warmer. (38) He decided to wait there, enjoying the peace while Rezia worked on the hat.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Septimus decide to do while Rezia worked?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"36\": \"As she sewed, Septimus stretched out, feeling relaxed in the warmth of the room.\",\n                \"37\": \"It reminded him of a cozy spot in the woods, where it\\\"s always a bit warmer.\",\n                \"38\": \"He decided to wait there, enjoying the peace while Rezia worked on the hat.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"38\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 38 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically states that Septimus \\\"decided to wait there, enjoying the peace while Rezia worked on the hat.\\\" This sentence clearly describes Septimus\\\"s action and choice during the moment, making it unique to answering this particular question.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who often said unkind things?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Rezia said that Mrs. Peters often said unkind things.\",\n                \"2\": \"Septimus wondered, \\\"What does Mr. Peters do?\\\".\",\n                \"3\": \"Rezia tried to remember.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"1\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 1 is the correct answer to the question because it directly states that Mrs. Peters often said unkind things, according to Rezia.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"What noise did Rezia make while working?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"33\": \"So, Rezia sewed.\",\n                \"34\": \"As she worked, she made soft sounds, like a kettle bubbling.\",\n                \"35\": \"Her fingers moved quickly, pushing and pulling the needle.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"34\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 34 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically describes the noise Rezia made (\\\"like a kettle bubbling\\\") while she was working.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"Where is he currently?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"4\": \"I think he travels for work.\",\n                \"5\": \"Right now, he\\\"s in Hull.\\\".\",\n                \"6\": \"Septimus shaded his eyes to see Rezia better.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"5\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 5 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically states that \\\"he\\\" is currently in Hull.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"Who helped Septimus?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"30\": \"Rezia knelt beside him to help.\",\n                \"31\": \"\\\"Now it\\\"s designed,\\\" he said.\",\n                \"32\": \"\\\"You need to sew it carefully, just like I set it out.\\\".\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"30\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 30 is the correct answer to the question because it mentions \\\"Rezia knelt beside him to help,\\\" indicating that Rezia was the person who helped Septimus.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_6\": \"What did her face look like while she was sewing?\",\n            \"answer_choices_6\": {\n                \"7\": \"He looked at her face bit by bit -

(5) His dad was busy reading the newspaper and said, \"Nothing!\".\n\n (6) William then went to the kitchen to find his mom. (7) \"What can I do?\". (8) he asked her. (9) \"Why don't you sit quietly for a while?\". (10) his mom suggested. (11) \"But sitting quietly isn't doing anything!\". (12) William complained. (13) He didn't like that idea at all. (14) His mom thought for a moment. (15) \"How about reading a book or drawing?\". (16) \"That feels like schoolwork. (17) I want to do something fun!\". (18) William replied. (19) His mom offered, \"I could teach you how to knit?\".\n\n (20) William didn't like that idea either. (21) He left the kitchen without saying anything. (22) He wandered into the living room.

(2) \"Did you see him? (3) How big is he?\". (4) \"Oh, yes, indeed I saw the dragon. (5) In fact, we became great friends,\" said the cat. (6) \"I used to hide in the bushes and talk to him when nobody was around. (7) He'snot a very big dragon, about the size of a large black bear, although I imagine he's grown quite a bit since I left. (8) He's got a long tail and yellow and blue stripes. (9) His horn and eyes and the bottoms of his feet are bright red, and he has gold-colored wings.\".\n\n (10) \"Oh, how wonderful!\". (11) said my father. (12) \"What did the animals do with him when his wing got well?\".\n\n (13) \"They started training him to carry passengers, and even though he is just a baby dragon, they work him all day and all night too sometimes. (14) They make him carry loads that are much too heavy, and if he complains, they twist his wings and beat him. (15) He's always tied to a stake on a rope just long enough to go across the river.

(2) But a big bear was blocking their way! (3) The bear stood up tall, looking very hungry. (4) \"What do we do?\". (5) asked the captain, looking worried. (6) \"Bears like meat,\" said the soldier. (7) He threw some meat to the bear, and they safely crossed the bridge.\n\n (8) But then, they met a roaring lion with wide-open jaws on the other side!\n\n (9) \"We should go back,\" said the captain. (10) \"We can't get past this lion.\". (11) \"Don't worry,\" replied the soldier. (12) \"Lions love bacon, and I have some.\". (13) He tossed bacon to the lion, who started eating, letting them pass.\n\n (14) That evening, they reached a big, shiny house. (15) The rooms sparkled, but they were very hungry and the house was empty.\n\n (16) The captain and another friend tried to find food, but there was nothing. (17) Luckily, the soldier shared his food, and they all ate happily.\n\n (18) The next day, the captain decided to hunt for food in the nearby forest, filled with hares and birds. (19) The other friend stayed to cook what was left. (20) The captain and the soldier hunted a lot and returned tired but successful. (21) They found their friend in trouble when they got back.\n\n (22) \"What happened?\". (23) asked the captain. (24) \"A tiny man with a beard and crutches visited,\" explained the friend. (25) \"He dropped a penny and couldn't pick it up because he was stiff.\".\n\n (26) \"I tried to help him,\" the friend continued. (27) \"But once I picked up the penny, the tiny man started hitting me with his crutches! (28) I couldn't even move.\".

(2) He walked up and down the riverbank, trying to think of a way to do it. (3) Then he saw a tall flagpole. (4) A rope was attached to it and stretched all the way across the river to the other side.\n\n (5) The rope went up over the top of the flagpole, through a loop, and came back down. (6) At the bottom, it wrapped around a big handle that could turn. (7) There was a sign on the handle, but the story didn’t say what it said.\n\n (8) My dad remembered something a cat had told him. (9) The rope was tied to a dragon’s neck on the other side! (10) He felt really sad for the dragon. (11) If the dragon was on this side, a gorilla would twist his wings. (12) This would hurt so much that he’d have to fly to the other side. (13) If the dragon was on the other side, the gorilla would turn the handle. (14) This could choke the dragon or make him fly back.\n\n (15) My dad didn’t want to call out to the dragon. (16) If he did, the gorilla might hear him. (17) He thought about climbing the pole and going across the rope. (18) But the pole was very tall. (19) If he made it to the top, he would still have to go across the river by moving hand over hand on the rope.\n\n (20) The river looked very muddy. (21) My dad thought there might be scary things living in it. (22) He couldn't think of any other way to get across.\n\n (23) Just as he was about to try climbing the pole, he heard a big splash. (24) It was getting dark, and even though monkeys were making a lot of noise, he turned to look. (25) He couldn’t see anything in the water, though.

(4) He spends so much time with them.\". (5) A third lady chimed in, \"Mr. Elliot is very handsome!\".\n\n (6) Another agreed, \"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who met him, says he's very charming!\".\n\n (7) One lady mentioned, \"Anne Elliot is pretty too, don't you think? (8) I find her more appealing than her sister.\". (9) The others agreed, \"Yes, we think Anne is lovelier. (10) But it seems all the men prefer her sister.\". (11) Anne wished her cousin would just walk silently beside her. (12) She found it hard to listen to him today. (13) Usually, Anne enjoyed his praises and his kind words. (14) But today, all she could think about was Captain Wentworth.\n\n (15) Was Captain Wentworth upset or not? (16) Anne wondered. (17) She couldn't focus until she knew. (18) She also needed to find out how long Mr. Elliot would stay in Bath. (19) Would Lady Russell meet him? (20) Anne had to explain to Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was marrying Captain Benwick. (21) It was a surprise to Lady Russell. (22) If Captain Wentworth and Lady Russell met by chance, Anne worried about what would happen.\n\n (23) The next morning, Anne and her friend were walking.

(26) There were many people around, but Anne recognized him right away.\n\n (27) She didn't expect Lady Russell to notice him until they were very close. (28) Anne watched Lady Russell, feeling nervous. (29) As they got closer, Anne knew Lady Russell was also watching him.

(2) Many people like to stand outside and hope to see the King. (3) The palace looks dignified and important because it is a symbol for many. (4) Near the palace, there is a memorial for Queen Victoria. (5) She was an old queen who used to ride through the city wearing glasses.\n\n (6) The man thought it was wonderful to live in such times. (7) He was walking home, feeling good and excited to tell Clarissa that he loved her. (8) He thought to himself that being happy is wonderful.\n\n (9) As he walked, he heard Big Ben, the large clock, start to chime. (10) It rang out the hour, loud and clear. (11) He thought about how parties at lunchtime could take up all afternoon.\n\n (12) When he reached his home, Clarissa was sitting in her room, feeling upset. (13) She was annoyed because she hadn’t invited Ellie Henderson to her party, and now Mrs. Marsham was meddling by telling Ellie she would be invited. (14) Clarissa didn’t want to invite boring people just because others said so.\n\n (15) At the same time, Elizabeth was spending time with Doris Kilman, which Clarissa didn’t like at all. (16) Then, suddenly, the clock struck three. (17) It surprised her how time had flown. (18) Just then, the door opened and Richard walked in with a big surprise. (19) He brought Clarissa flowers, red and white roses! (20) Clarissa was so happy. (21) She didn’t need words to know Richard loved her. (22) She put the roses in vases and they looked beautiful.\n\n (23) Clarissa asked if Richard had fun at Lady Bruton's lunch. (24) She wondered if Lady Bruton had asked about her. (25) Then she remembered Peter Walsh was back in town. (26) Mrs. Marsham had even sent a letter about it. (27) Clarissa thought about whether she should invite Ellie Henderson after all.\n\n (28) Richard suggested they sit and talk for a bit. (29) The room was empty and ready for the party they were planning. (30) Clarissa remembered Peter Walsh was getting a divorce and still loved someone else. (31) Nothing much about him had changed.

(2) One day, she went upstairs to her room. (3) First, she stopped by a window, then walked into the bathroom. (4) There, she noticed the green floor and a tap that was dripping water. \n\n(5) She felt that something was missing in her life, like an empty attic room. (6) She thought about how, sometimes, women have to change how they dress or look different during the day. \n\n(7) In her room, she put away a yellow hat with feathers on her bed. (8) The bed had clean, tight sheets. (9) The bed seemed too narrow to her. (10) She had a candle that was half burnt down. (11) She liked to read a lot, especially late at night. (12) One of her favorite books was about a big retreat in a place called Moscow.\n\n (13) Sometimes, she would read instead of sleeping because she often found it hard to sleep. (14) She thought about many things while lying in her bed. (15) She remembered moments when she felt she didn't connect with others the way she wanted to. (16) She wasn't sure what she was missing, but it wasn't beauty or intelligence. (17) It was something deeper, something that made people feel warm and connected.\n\n (18) She also remembered times when other women would tell her their secrets or silly mistakes they made. (19) She felt something special during those talks, something that men might feel, too. (20) It was brief but powerful, like a quick, beautiful glow that filled her with joy.\n\n (21) She also thought about old memories of love, like with her friend Sally Seton. (22) She wondered if what they had was really love. (23) At night, when she was still awake, the floor would creak. (24) Sometimes, her husband Richard would come upstairs quietly. (25) He often made noise by accident, and it made her laugh.\n\n (26) This lady often thought about love and what it really means, especially as she put away her coat and remembered her friend Sally.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"Who did she remember while putting away her coat?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"24\": \"Sometimes, her husband Richard would come upstairs quietly.\",\n                \"25\": \"He often made noise by accident, and it made her laugh.\",\n                \"26\": \"This lady often thought about love and what it really means, especially as she put away her coat and remembered her friend Sally.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"26\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 26 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that she remembered her friend Sally while putting away her coat.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Where did the lady go after stopping by the window?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Once there was a lady who lived in a big house.\",\n                \"2\": \"One day, she went upstairs to her room.\",\n                \"3\": \"First, she stopped by a window, then walked into the bathroom.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"3\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 3 is the correct answer to the question because it specifies that after stopping by a window, she walked into the bathroom.

(2) But soon, she got a chance to move closer to where things were happening. (3) She ended up sitting at the very end of the bench, where more people could see her.\n\n (4) While she was sitting there, Anne saw Captain Wentworth nearby. (5) He noticed her too but seemed a bit serious, not like how he usually looked. (6) Anne wondered what might be wrong. (7) She thought maybe it had something to do with her dad or Lady Russell, who might have upset him.\n\n (8) Captain Wentworth walked over slowly and started talking about the concert. (9) He didn't seem to enjoy it much and said he was looking forward to it ending. (10) Anne tried to make him feel better by talking about the good parts of the concert. (11) This made him smile a bit. (12) They chatted for a little while, and Captain Wentworth seemed happier. (13) He was just about to join Anne on the bench when Mr. Elliot interrupted. (14) Mr. Elliot needed Anne's help to understand the Italian song that was going to be sung next. (15) Anne helped him, but she really wished she could keep talking to Captain Wentworth.\n\n (16) When she was done helping Mr. Elliot, Captain Wentworth was about to leave. (17) He said goodnight to Anne quickly and mentioned he had to get home. (18) Anne asked if he didn't want to stay for the next song, hoping he would stay. (19) But he said there was nothing worth staying for and left.\n\n (20) Anne realized that Captain Wentworth might be feeling jealous of Mr. Elliot. (21) She was surprised because she didn't realize Captain Wentworth felt that way about her. (22) At first, this made her happy, but then she became worried. (23) She didn't know how to show him that she really cared about him, not Mr. Elliot.\n\n (24) Anne felt sad thinking about Captain Wentworth being upset. (25) She didn't want him to be jealous or to misunderstand her feelings. (26) She wondered how she could make things right between them.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did Anne not want Captain Wentworth to

(3) He was like a man covered in snow that doesn't melt, feeling sad forever.\n\n (4) \"Look,\" she said again because he was talking to himself outside.\n\n (5) \"Oh, look,\" she begged him. (6) But there was only a few sheep around. (7) Maisie Johnson needed help. (8) She had just come from Edinburgh and wanted to find Regent’s Park Tube station.\n\n (9) \"Not this way—over there!\". (10) said Rezia, pointing. (11) She didn't want Maisie to notice Septimus. (12) Maisie thought the couple looked strange. (13) She had just moved to London and everything felt so new and odd. (14) She would remember this walk in Regent’s Park for a very long time.\n\n (15) She thought the couple might be arguing or maybe saying goodbye forever. (16) Something was definitely wrong. (17) Now, walking again, she saw old people in chairs and pretty flowers. (18) London seemed so different from Edinburgh. (19) Dogs were playing, and squirrels were looking for food. (20) Maisie felt overwhelmed and almost wanted to cry.\n\n (21) She thought maybe she should have stayed at home, just as her family had warned her.\n\n (22) Maisie tried to calm herself by holding onto the park railing.\n\n (23) Mrs. Dempster, who was feeding squirrels, watched Maisie. (24) She thought the girl didn’t know much about life yet.\n\n (25) Mrs. Dempster had lived a tough life.

(2) The woman seemed very upset and said, \"Well, then I shall die.\". (3) She moved suddenly as she spoke. (4) The man felt sorry and said, \"I'm sorry for life.\".\n\n (5) She asked, \"Sorry for whom?\".\n\n (6) \"Sorry for you,\" he replied.\n\n (7) She whispered back very quietly, \"No need,\" and moved again.\n\n (8) This made the man a bit upset. (9) He wondered why she didn't think more about her choices. (10) \"Don't you think you could choose a better path?\". (11) he asked. (12) \"I don't think anything,\" she answered.\n\n (13) He tried to explain to her that life could be beautiful. (14) \"You're still young. (15) You could find love, get married, and be happy.\".\n\n (16) The woman wasn't convinced. (17) \"Not all married people are happy,\" she said sharply.\n\n (18) The man agreed, \"Not all, but being loved is better than being alone. (19) Life can be sweet, even with sadness.\". (20) He felt strongly about this and wanted to help her see there could be more to life than her current sadness. (21) He spoke passionately, not just thinking but feeling his words.\n\n (22) \"I'm not perfect either,\" he admitted. (23) \"I've made mistakes, like coming here while drunk. (24) But I can leave and change.\". (25) \"You, however, might feel stuck,\" he continued. (26) \"Being here might feel like you're trapped and can't escape. (27) It's like being a slave to your situation.\". (28) He guessed she might owe money to someone, making it even harder for her to leave. (29) \"That's like a chain holding you back,\" he explained.\n\n (30) He wanted her to understand that there were better choices she could make. (31) \"You don't have to stay stuck here. (32) Life can be different, better.\". (33) The woman listened but didn't say anything. (34) She just looked at him, and he looked back at her. (35) They had just met, and their conversation was deep and intense.\n\n (36) \"Is this the way people should meet?\". (37) he asked finally. (38) \"It feels wrong, doesn't it?\".

(2) He even looked at the man's clothes in a not-so-nice way.\n\n (3) Ferfitchkin laughed and said, \"Oh, don't make him feel shy!\".\n\n (4) The man quickly replied, \"I'm not feeling shy. (5) I am eating here with my own money, not someone else's. (6) Remember that, Mr. (7) Ferfitchkin.\". (8) Ferfitchkin got very mad and his face turned red like a lobster. (9) He said, \"Isn't everyone here paying for their own food? (10) What are you trying to say?\". (11) The man realized he had said too much. (12) \"Maybe we should talk about something smarter,\" he suggested.\n\n (13) \"Do you want to show us how smart you are?\". (14) Ferfitchkin asked. (15) The man answered, \"No, that's not needed here.\".\n\n (16) \"Why are you talking so much?\". (17) another friend joined in. (18) \"Have you lost your mind?\". (19) Zverkov, trying to control the situation, said, \"Enough, everyone! (20) Let's stop arguing.\". (21) Simonov whispered, \"This is really silly.\".\n\n (22) Trudolyubov said loudly, \"It's silly. (23) We came to have a nice goodbye dinner for a friend, and you are ruining it. (24) You weren't even invited.\". (25) Zverkov agreed, \"Enough! (26) Let's change the subject. (27) Let me tell you how I almost got married two days ago.\".\n\n (28) Then Zverkov told a funny story about his almost-marriage. (29) Everyone laughed, but they didn’t talk about the wedding much. (30) The story was more about generals and other important people. (31) Everyone seemed to enjoy it except the man who felt ignored and embarrassed.\n\n (32) He thought to himself, \"These people don't understand me. (33) I shouldn't have let Ferfitchkin make me feel this way. (34) I don't belong here. (35) My clothes aren't right, and Zverkov even noticed a stain on my pants.\".\n\n (36) The man decided, \"I should leave right now without saying anything. (37) I'll show them I don't care!\". (38) But he stayed. (39) He drank some wine, which he wasn’t used to. (40) It made him feel bold and upset. (41) He wanted to say something big and leave so they would think he was clever.\n\n (42) He looked around at everyone. (43) They were all having fun and not paying him any attention.

{"data_row": {"id": "cm0r08jjl3pb30739c9xe3jdp", "global_key": "e1a47_3_10", "row_data": "Grade level: 3 Key Evidence\n\nBook Title: Notes from the Underground\n\nBook Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nParagraph: (1) Boys and girls, let me tell you a story about a person who thought it was better to do nothing at all! (2) This person thought living like a mole underground was the best way to live. (3) But guess what? (4) Even while saying that, he realized he wasn't being completely honest. (5) He actually didn't like being underground at all. (6) He was really looking for something completely different, something he couldn’t find, and that made him upset!\n\n (7) He even told people that he didn’t believe in the things he was writing about. (8) He felt like he was telling tales, just like when someone pretends while playing. (9) Can you imagine that? (10) He wrote down his thoughts but didn’t quite believe in them himself.\n\n (11) \"Why write all these things then?\". (12) you might ask. (13) Well, he thought about what would happen if he was left alone with nothing to do forever. (14) That made him wonder about life and how confusing it can be sometimes.\n\n (15) He admitted that he sometimes talked without making sense, just to amuse others. (16) He acted bravely, like he wasn’t afraid of anything, but deep down, he was really trying to make everyone like him. (17) He even tried to joke around to keep things light-hearted, even though he knew his jokes weren’t that funny.\n\n (18) He talked a lot about how he felt and the things he went through, but he didn’t really respect his own feelings. (19) He was very open, sharing his thoughts with everyone, but maybe he shared too much. (20) He was afraid to say what he really wanted to say, hiding his true thoughts.\n\n (21) Even though he thought a lot, he realized his heart wasn’t in the right place, which made everything more confusing. (22) He kept insisting on things, but it wasn’t always the truth. (23) He said it was all lies! (24) But here’s a secret: all those things he said other people were saying? (25) He made them all up himself! (26) For forty years, he listened and made up stories. (27) That’s quite a long time to make up stories, isn’t it?\n\n (28) In the end, he wondered why he was writing all this if he didn’t plan to share it with anyone. (29) He called his imaginary friends \"gentlemen\" and wrote as if they were reading his stories. (30) But he confessed he was not brave enough to actually show his writings to anyone.

(2) Dad was waiting for another boar to pass too. (3) He didn't wait too long because he had a plan. (4) Soon, Dad followed a path that led to a small stream. (5) He was very thirsty, so he decided to stop and drink some water. (6) Dad had rubber boots on, so he stepped into a small pool of water. (7) Just as he was about to drink, something surprising happened!\n\n (8) A sharp thing grabbed Dad by his pants and lifted him up! (9) He was hanging in the air, right above the water.\n\n (10) A deep, angry voice said, \"Don't you know this is my private crying pool?\".\n\n (11) Dad couldn't see who was talking because he was up in the air. (12) He replied, \"Oh, no, I'm so sorry. (13) I didn't know anyone had a private crying pool.\".\n\n (14) \"Not everyone does,\" the voice said. (15) \"But I do because I have a big reason to cry, and I splash anyone I find in my pool!\".\n\n (16) With that, the creature shook Dad up and down over the water.

(5) Maybe it’s not because we are better but because of how we live. (6) We stay at home a lot and think about our feelings.\".\n\n (7) \"Men,\" she added, \"have jobs and other things that keep them busy. (8) These things make them forget their feelings faster.\".\n\n (9) Captain Harville thought about it and said, \"But our friend Benwick wasn’t busy, and he still forgot his love quickly.\".\n\n (10) Anne agreed, \"That’s true. (11) It must be something inside him that changed.\". (12) She continued, \"It's not fair to say only men forget. (13) Women can be strong in feelings just like men.\". (14) \"But,\" replied Captain Harville, \"Men might be stronger, but women's feelings are very tender.\".\n\n (15) Anne explained, \"Men live tough lives; they work hard and face many dangers. (16) It would be too much if they also had to deal with strong feelings like women do.\".\n\n (17) Captain Harville started to disagree when they heard a noise. (18) It was Captain Wentworth, who was also in the room. (19) His pen had dropped. (20) They wondered if he was listening to their conversation.\n\n (21) Captain Harville asked him, \"Are you done with your letter?\".\n\n (22) Captain Wentworth answered, \"Almost, just a little bit left.\".\n\n (23) Captain Harville told him, \"Take your time. (24) No rush.\". (25) Then, turning back to Anne, he whispered, \"We might never agree on this topic. (26) Men and women see it differently. (27) There are many stories and books that say women are fickle, but maybe that’s because men wrote them.\".\n\n (28) Anne listened, thinking about how everyone sees love differently.\n\n\n\nQuestion:

(2) It was all because of a funny thing they saw. (3) After they giggled a lot, Dad finished untying the dragon. (4) The dragon was so happy, he started running around and even tried to flip over!\n\n (5) My dad was excited to start a new adventure. (6) When the dragon calmed down, Dad climbed onto his back. (7) The dragon was ready to go. (8) \"All aboard!\". (9) the dragon cheered. (10) \"Where to?\". (11) \"We'll sleep on the beach tonight,\" Dad replied, \"and tomorrow, we'll begin our journey home. (12) Let's head to the beaches of Tangerina!\". (13) With that, they flew over dark jungles and a muddy river.\n\n (14) Below them, animals were making noise. (15) Even the crocodiles seemed to be having a party, eating pink lollipops and smiling big smiles. (16) They didn't care about crossing the river or anything else happening above.\n\n (17) As Dad and the dragon flew over the Ocean Rocks, they heard a tiny voice shouting, \"Bum cack! (18) Bum cack! (19) We dreed our nagon! (20) Oops, I mean, we need our dragon!\". (21) But Dad and the dragon were happy flying away. (22) They knew they wouldn't go back to Wild Island ever again.

(3) “I’d love to have some.”\n\nWilliam decided to bring her syringa, handfuls of syringa, armfuls of syringa.\n\n (4) He went straight home to the gardener.\n\n (5) “No, I ain’t got no syringa. (6) Please step off my rose-bed, Mister William. (7) No, there ain’t any syringa in this ’ere garding. (8) I dunno for why. (9) Please leave my ’ose pipe alone, Mister William.”\n\n\n\n“Huh!” ejaculated William, scornfully turning away.\n\n (10) He went round the garden. (11) The gardener had been quite right. (12) There were guelder roses everywhere, but no syringa.\n\n (13) He climbed the fence and surveyed the next garden. (14) There were guelder roses everywhere, but no syringa.\n\n (15) It must have been some peculiarity in the soil. (16) William strolled down the road, scanning the gardens as he went. (17) All had guelder roses. (18) None had syringa. (19) Suddenly he stopped.\n\n (20) On a table in the window of a small house at the bottom of the road was a vase of syringa. (21) He did not know who lived there. (22) He entered the garden cautiously. (23) No one was about. (24) He looked into the room. (25) It was empty. (26) The window was open at the bottom. (27) He scrambled in, removing several layers of white paint from the window-sill as he did so. (28) He was determined to have that syringa. (29) He took it dripping from the vase, and was preparing to depart, when the door opened and a fat woman appeared upon the threshold. (30) The scream that she emitted at sight of William curdled the very blood in his veins. (31) She dashed to the window, and William, in self-defence, dodged round the table and out of the door. (32) The back door was open, and William blindly fled by it. (33) The fat woman did not pursue. (34) She was leaning out of the window, and her shrieks rent the air.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"How did William escape?\",\n

(2) She was hurt and needed a lot of time to get better. (3) Two wise women talked about it and agreed that it happened because of some careless mistakes. (4) They thought it was very scary how long it might take for her to feel okay again.\n\n (5) Admiral Croft heard about the accident and was very surprised. (6) He said, \"Oh, this is a terrible way for a young man to show his love, by accidentally hurting his lady! (7) He tried to help, but it only caused more trouble.\".\n\n (8) Admiral Croft was a kind-hearted man with a simple way of doing things. (9) Anne liked him even though he was a bit different from what Lady Russell preferred.\n\n (10) One day, he said to Anne, \"It must be strange for you to see us living here. (11) Feel free to look around the house whenever you want. (12) There's no need to be shy.\". (13) Anne thanked him but chose not to look around right then. (14) She could visit another time. (15) Admiral Croft continued, \"We haven't changed much in the house. (16) But we did fix the laundry door, and it's much better now. (17) I think it's a big improvement!\". (18) He explained that most of the changes were his wife's ideas. (19) He only moved some big mirrors because there were too many for him. (20) He preferred just a small one for shaving. (21) Anne smiled but didn't know what to say. (22) The Admiral wanted to be polite, so he talked more about the house and the changes they had made.\n\n (23) He made sure Anne felt welcome, and they both talked about simple things, like where to keep umbrellas and how different people like different things.

(3) They were all waiting to see something special. (4) Near the door, there was a sign that said:\n\nPLACE FOR TAKING OFF SHOES AND BEING SILENT\n\n\n\nWilliam told a few people to be very quiet.

(7) Above her bed was another sign:\n\nFAT WILD WOMAN TALKING IN STRANGE LANGUAGE\n\n\n\nEveryone stood around her bed quietly, listening. (8) They were all excited. (9) The noises kept going. (10) William only let them stay for two minutes. (11) After that, they had to leave. (12) They paid more money, went to the end of the line, and came in again. (13) More and more kids showed up just to see Aunt Emily.\n\n (14) Other parts of the show were forgotten. (15) The painted rat, the sleeping dog, and the toys like the Russian Bear were all ignored. (16) Everyone rushed past them to stand in line outside Aunt Emily’s room.\n\n (17) People who left the room just went back to the line to see Aunt Emily again. (18) Some even went home to get more money because seeing Aunt Emily again cost a little extra.\n\n (19) The church bell rang for Sunday School, but nobody left the show. (20) That evening, the vicar was very sad because not many people went to Sunday School. (21) It was a record low because everyone wanted to see Aunt Emily sleep and snore.\n\n (22) But William always wanted to do more.

(2) He said, \"The child is doing well, and I want to meet the Captain. (3) Maybe I'll visit them tonight. (4) I won't stay for dinner, but I might stop by for a little while.\".\n\n (5) His wife, Mary, didn't want him to go. (6) She worried and said, \"Oh, no, Charles! (7) Please don't leave. (8) What if something happens to our child while you're gone?\".\n\n (9) The next morning, the child was still doing well. (10) Mr. Robinson, the doctor, checked and found the child okay. (11) Charles felt it was okay not to stay indoors all the time. (12) The child needed to rest, but Charles thought he couldn't do much to help at home. (13) His father also wanted him to meet Captain Wentworth. (14) So, Charles decided to visit him. (15) Charles told his father, \"The child is doing well. (16) I'm going to visit Captain Wentworth. (17) My sister is with Mary, so it's okay for me to go.\".\n\n (18) Mary knew Charles had made up his mind and wouldn't change it. (19) She didn't say anything until Charles left the room. (20) Then she spoke to Anne. (21) \"So, Anne, it looks like it's just you and me to take care of the sick child tonight. (22) No one else will visit us. (23) This always happens to me. (24) When something tough comes up, men always seem to find a way out.\".\n\n (25) Mary was upset. (26) \"It's not fair. (27) Charles gets to go out, and I have to stay because I'm the mom.

(2) They were so many that they barely had enough food or clothes. (3) Among his children, the youngest daughter was the prettiest of all. (4) She was so beautiful that everyone admired her. (5) One stormy Thursday evening in the fall, the family was gathered inside their small home. (6) Outside, the wind howled and the rain beat against the windows. (7) Suddenly, they heard three taps on the window. (8) The father went outside to check and saw a huge White Bear.\n\n (9) \"Good evening to you!\". (10) greeted the White Bear. (11) \"Good evening!\". (12) replied the father. (13) The bear had a request. (14) \"Will you let your youngest daughter come with me? (15) If you do, I will make you rich,\" he said. (16) The father was unsure, so he went inside to talk to his daughter. (17) He explained that the White Bear could make them rich if she went with him.\n\n (18) At first, the daughter said, \"No!\". (19) She did not want to go. (20) But her father talked more about the riches and a better life, so she started to think it might be a good idea. (21) She got ready, fixing her clothes as best as she could.\n\n (22) The next Thursday, the White Bear returned. (23) The daughter climbed onto his back, ready for the journey.\n\n (24) \"Are you scared?\". (25) asked the Bear as they rode. (26) \"No,\" she answered confidently.\n\n (27) \"Just hold tight to my coat, and you'll be safe,\" the Bear reassured her.\n\n (28) They traveled a long, long way until they reached a steep hill. (29) The Bear knocked on the hillside, and a door opened. (30) They entered a magnificent castle filled with light, silver, and gold. (31) It was more beautiful than anything she had ever seen.\n\n (32) The Bear gave her a silver bell. (33) \"Ring this whenever you need something,\" he told her.\n\n (34) The castle had many shiny rooms, and a grand table was set with delicious food. (35) The girl realized that this new life might be wonderful. (36) In the castle, she could have everything she needed just by ringing the bell.\n\n\n\nQuestion: {\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question_1\": \"What did the girl think about her new life?\",\n            \"answer_choices_1\": {\n                \"34\": \"The castle had many shiny rooms, and a grand table was set with delicious food.\",\n                \"35\": \"The girl realized that this new life might be wonderful.\",\n                \"36\": \"In the castle, she could have everything she needed just by ringing the bell.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_1\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"35\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 35 is the correct answer to the question because it directly states the girl\\\"s realization about her new life potentially being wonderful.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_2\": \"Who was the prettiest among the farmer\\\"s children?\",\n            \"answer_choices_2\": {\n                \"1\": \"Once upon a time, there was a farmer who lived with his large family.\",\n                \"2\": \"They were so many that they barely had enough food or clothes.\",\n                \"3\": \"Among his children, the youngest daughter was the prettiest of all.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_2\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"3\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 3 is the correct answer to the question because it explicitly states that the youngest daughter was the prettiest of all the farmer\\\"s children.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_3\": \"What did the Bear give her?\",\n            \"answer_choices_3\": {\n                \"31\": \"It was more beautiful than anything she had ever seen.\",\n                \"32\": \"The Bear gave her a silver bell.\",\n                \"33\": \"\\\"Ring this whenever you need something,\\\" he told her.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_3\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"32\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 32 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically mentions that the Bear gave her a silver bell, which directly answers what the Bear gave her.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_4\": \"What was the weather like on that Thursday evening?\",\n            \"answer_choices_4\": {\n                \"4\": \"She was so beautiful that everyone admired her.\",\n                \"5\": \"One stormy Thursday evening in the fall, the family was gathered inside their small home.\",\n                \"6\": \"Outside, the wind howled and the rain beat against the windows.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_4\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"6\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 6 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically describes the weather conditions outside during the evening, mentioning that the wind howled and the rain beat against the windows.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"question_5\": \"What did they find inside the castle?\",\n            \"answer_choices_5\": {\n                \"28\": \"They traveled a long, long way until they reached a steep hill.\",\n                \"29\": \"The Bear knocked on the hillside, and a door opened.\",\n                \"30\": \"They entered a magnificent castle filled with light, silver, and gold.\"\n            },\n            \"teacher_solution_5\": {\n                \"correct_answer\": \"30\",\n                \"explanation\": \"Sentence 30 is the correct answer to the question because it specifically describes what they found inside the castle: a magnificent castle filled with light, silver, and gold.

(2) The princess was worried and said, \"Please leave. (3) A scary troll with three heads lives here. (4) He will catch you!\". (5) But the soldier was fearless. (6) He said, \"I'm not scared, even if he has four heads! (7) I'm staying to save you.\". (8) The princess, seeing his bravery, decided to help him. (9) She told him to hide behind a large vat in the hallway. (10) She would make the troll sleepy by scratching his heads.\n\n (11) \"After I trick the troll and go out to call the chickens, you must hurry and join me,\" she explained. (12) \"But first, see if you can lift the troll's heavy sword from the table.\".\n\n (13) The soldier tried to lift the sword but couldn't. (14) It was too heavy! (15) So, he drank a magic potion from a horn behind the door. (16) With the first sip, he could barely move it. (17) After a second sip, he lifted it a bit. (18) Finally, after a big gulp, he swung the sword easily!\n\n (19) Soon, the troll came home, making the whole palace shake. (20) \"I smell a human in here!\". (21) the troll grumbled. (22) The princess quickly said, \"A raven dropped a human bone down the chimney. (23) I cleaned it up, but the smell might still be around.\".\n\n (24) \"Perhaps you're right,\" said the troll.\n\n (25) \"Come, lie down, and I'll scratch your heads. (26) The smell will be gone when you wake up,\" she told him.\n\n (27) The troll agreed and soon fell asleep, snoring loudly. (28) The princess put cushions under his heads and signaled the soldier by calling the chickens.\n\n (29) Quietly, the soldier came in with the sword and chopped off all three of the troll's heads!\n\n (30) The princess was very happy. (31) She and the soldier went to free her sisters. (32) They crossed a courtyard and walked through many rooms to a big door.\n\n (33) \"Here's where my sister is,\" she said.\n\n (34) Inside, everything was made of silver, and her sister was at a spinning wheel. (35) \"Oh no, what are you doing here?\". (36) the second sister asked in fear. (37) \"I'm here to rescue you from the troll,\" said the soldier.\n\n (38) \"Please leave before the troll returns.
