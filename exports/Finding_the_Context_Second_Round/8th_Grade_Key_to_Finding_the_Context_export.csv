            ""correct_answer"": ""B"",
            ""explanation"": ""Choice B (elapse) is correct because it's a noun meaning 'the passage of time' and fits the context of measuring time since the robbery. Choice A is incorrect because while 'interval' is similar, the sentence structure requires the specific noun 'elapse.' Choice C is incorrect because 'duration' would require different sentence structure. Choice D is incorrect because 'period' is too general for this specific context.""

            ""explanation"": ""Choice C (apprehend) is correct because it's the most appropriate law enforcement term for catching a suspect. Choice A is incorrect because while 'capture' is similar, it's less formal in this context. Choice B is incorrect because 'detain' implies temporary holding rather than catching. Choice D is incorrect because 'seize' typically refers to taking objects rather than arresting people.""
